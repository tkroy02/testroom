  "summary": "The mirror equation (1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ) and magnification formula (M = -dᵢ/dₒ) provide complete mathematical description of image formation in spherical mirrors. A consistent sign convention—where f > 0 for concave mirrors, f < 0 for convex mirrors, dₒ > 0 for real objects, dᵢ > 0 for real images, dᵢ < 0 for virtual images, M > 0 for upright images, and M < 0 for inverted images—allows unified treatment of all mirror types. These relationships derive from geometric optics and work within the paraxial approximation, becoming less accurate for large angles or apertures due to spherical aberration. Problem-solving strategies involve systematic application of the equations with careful attention to signs, while graphical analysis using reciprocal plots provides experimental verification methods. The equations extend to complex multi-mirror systems by treating images as subsequent objects. Mastering these mathematical tools enables prediction of image position, size, and orientation for any spherical mirror configuration, forming the foundation for optical design in applications ranging from everyday mirrors to sophisticated astronomical telescopes."
