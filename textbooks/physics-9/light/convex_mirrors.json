  "expanded_description": "This section examines convex mirrors, which are diverging mirrors that always produce virtual, upright, and reduced images. Students will learn the unique properties of convex mirrors, their ray diagram construction, mathematical relationships, and why they are essential for safety applications despite image distortion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Convex mirrors diverge incoming parallel light rays, creating virtual images that are always upright, reduced in size, and located behind the mirror surface, providing wider fields of view than plane mirrors of equivalent size.",
    "explanation": "The outward curvature of convex mirrors causes reflected rays to spread apart, making them appear to originate from a virtual focal point behind the mirror. This diverging property creates images that are smaller but show more of the surrounding environment, making convex mirrors ideal for security and safety applications."

  "summary": "Convex mirrors are diverging optical elements characterized by their outward curvature and negative focal length (f = -R/2). They always produce virtual, upright, and reduced images located behind the mirror surface, regardless of object position. Ray diagrams using three principal rays (parallel, focal, and radial) with backward extensions demonstrate these consistent properties. The mirror equation (1/f = 1/dₒ + 1/dᵢ) and magnification formula (M = -dᵢ/dₒ) apply with f < 0, dᵢ < 0, and 0 < M < 1. Convex mirrors exhibit barrel distortion and compress perceived distances, leading to the safety warning 'Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.' Their primary advantage is a wide field of view—approximately 2-3 times wider than equivalent plane mirrors—making them ideal for safety and security applications in vehicles, stores, warehouses, and intersections. While they distort images and reduce object sizes, this trade-off is acceptable for applications where comprehensive area monitoring is more important than image fidelity. Convex mirrors fill a unique niche in optical systems where maximum visibility trumps accurate representation."
