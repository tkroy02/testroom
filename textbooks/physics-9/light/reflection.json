  "expanded_description": "This section explores the phenomenon of light reflection, where light rays bounce off surfaces. Students will learn the laws governing reflection, differentiate between specular and diffuse reflection, understand image formation in mirrors, and explore practical applications of reflective surfaces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Reflection occurs when light rays encounter a boundary between two different media and bounce back into the original medium. The angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the behavior depends on the smoothness of the surface relative to the light's wavelength.",
    "explanation": "All reflection follows the same fundamental law, but the nature of the reflecting surface determines whether we see clear images (smooth surfaces) or scattered light (rough surfaces). Mirrors utilize controlled reflection to form predictable images through geometric optics principles."

        "definition": "**Law of Reflection:**\n- The incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane\n- The angle of incidence ($θ_i$) equals the angle of reflection ($θ_r$)\n- Mathematically: $θ_i = θ_r$\n\n**Key Definitions:**\n- **Incident Ray:** Incoming light ray approaching the surface\n- **Reflected Ray:** Outgoing light ray leaving the surface\n- **Normal:** Imaginary line perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence\n- **Point of Incidence:** Exact location where light strikes the surface",
        "context": "This law applies to all types of reflection and all wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation, not just visible light. It's a consequence of the wave nature of light and the boundary conditions at interfaces."

  "summary": "Reflection follows the fundamental law that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection ($θ_i = θ_r$), with both measured from the surface normal. Specular reflection from smooth surfaces (irregularities < light wavelength) produces clear images, while diffuse reflection from rough surfaces scatters light, enabling vision of most objects. Plane mirrors create virtual images that are upright, same-sized, and laterally inverted, located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. Curved mirrors include concave (converging) types that can produce real or virtual images depending on object position, and convex (diverging) types that always produce virtual, reduced images. The mirror equation ($1/f = 1/d_o + 1/d_i$) and magnification formula ($M = -d_i/d_o$) quantify image properties using sign conventions. Applications range from everyday mirrors to sophisticated telescopes, periscopes, and optical instruments. Advanced phenomena include total internal reflection for fiber optics and polarization at Brewster's angle. Reflection principles form the foundation for controlling light paths in numerous technological systems while explaining common visual experiences."
