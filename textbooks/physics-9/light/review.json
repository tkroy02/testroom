  "summary": "This comprehensive review covers the complete light and optics unit, testing understanding from fundamental concepts of light as electromagnetic radiation to practical applications of mirror systems. Questions range from conceptual explanations of wave-particle duality and reflection types to mathematical applications of the mirror equation and magnification formula. Problem-solving requires systematic application of sign conventions, construction and interpretation of ray diagrams, and analysis of experimental data. Comparative questions assess understanding of when to use different mirror types based on their imaging characteristics and field of view properties. Integrated scenarios challenge students to connect concepts across the unit, from photon energy calculations in the EM spectrum to designing practical optical systems using appropriate mirror types. Mastery of these questions demonstrates the ability to both calculate precise image characteristics and explain the physical principles underlying diverse optical phenomena in everyday and technological contexts."
