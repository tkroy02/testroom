  "expanded_description": "This section focuses exclusively on plane (flat) mirrors, exploring their image formation properties, optical characteristics, and practical applications. Students will learn to construct accurate ray diagrams, understand virtual image formation, and apply the mathematical relationships governing plane mirror optics.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Plane mirrors produce virtual images that are upright, laterally inverted, and located as far behind the mirror as the object is in front, with the image size always equal to the object size.",
    "explanation": "The image in a plane mirror appears to be behind the mirror surface because our brain extrapolates reflected light rays backward along straight lines. Since no light actually originates from behind the mirror, the image is classified as virtual rather than real."

  "summary": "Plane mirrors produce virtual images through specular reflection, with the fundamental relationship that image distance behind the mirror equals object distance in front ($d_i = -d_o$). These images are always upright, same-sized (M = +1), and laterally inverted (left-right reversed). Ray diagrams constructed using perpendicular and oblique rays demonstrate that only a half-height mirror is needed to see one's full reflection, regardless of distance. Multiple mirrors create complex image arrays, with perpendicular mirrors producing three images and parallel mirrors creating infinite images. Practical applications include periscopes for seeing around obstacles, kaleidoscopes for decorative patterns, and optical instruments for beam steering. Common misconceptions include the nature of mirror reversal (actually front-back, not left-right) and distance perception (accurate in plane mirrors vs distorted in convex mirrors). Mathematical analysis enables solving problems involving image locations, relative motions, and complex multi-mirror systems, all based on the consistent application of the law of reflection and geometric optics principles."
