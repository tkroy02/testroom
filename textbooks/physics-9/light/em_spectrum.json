  "summary": "The electromagnetic spectrum encompasses all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, from long-wavelength radio waves (~1 mm-100 km) to short-wavelength gamma rays (<10 pm), all traveling at c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum and obeying c = fλ. Radio waves enable communication through atmospheric penetration and antenna resonance. Microwaves interact with molecular rotations (cooking, radar). Infrared radiation corresponds to molecular vibrations and thermal emission (thermal imaging). Visible light (400-700 nm) represents the narrow band detectable by human eyes, coinciding with peak solar output. Ultraviolet radiation causes electronic excitations and DNA damage (tanning, sterilization). X-rays penetrate matter differentially for medical imaging, generated by electron deceleration and transitions. Gamma rays originate from nuclear processes and are the most energetic and penetrating. Earth's atmosphere is transparent only in specific 'windows' (radio, optical, some IR), necessitating space-based observatories for full-spectrum astronomy. Applications range from communications and medicine to astronomy and materials analysis, with safety concerns increasing with photon energy, particularly at ionizing frequencies (UV and above) where DNA damage can occur."
