Students will learn about the electromagnetic spectrum, how light is produced, its fundamental properties, and the historical experiments that revealed its true character.",

    "principle": "Light is an electromagnetic wave that exhibits dual behavior—it can be described as both a wave (with frequency, wavelength, and speed) and a stream of particles called photons, with its energy quantized in discrete packets.",

  "summary": "Light exhibits dual wave-particle nature: as an electromagnetic wave, it consists of perpendicular oscillating electric and magnetic fields propagating at c = 3.00 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum, obeying c = fλ, with different frequencies corresponding to different colors and regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. As a particle phenomenon, light consists of photons with quantized energy E = hf, explaining the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering. Historical experiments like Young's double-slit demonstrate wave properties (interference), while the photoelectric effect demonstrates particle properties. Light is produced through thermal radiation (blackbody spectrum described by Wien's and Stefan-Boltzmann laws) and atomic transitions (emitting characteristic line spectra). In materials, light slows down according to the refractive index n = c/v, changing wavelength but not frequency. This dual nature forms the foundation for understanding all optical phenomena and modern physics."
