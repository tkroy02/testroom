  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the kinematics of circular motion, describing how objects move along curved paths. Students will learn to quantify rotational motion using angular quantities, relate linear and angular motion, and understand the concept of centripetal acceleration required for curved trajectories.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Circular motion involves objects moving at constant speed along a circular path while continuously changing direction. This requires a centripetal (center-seeking) acceleration directed toward the center of the circle.",
    "explanation": "Even when speed is constant in circular motion, velocity is constantly changing due to the continuous change in direction. This acceleration toward the center is what distinguishes circular motion from straight-line motion and requires a net inward force."

Key relationships include: $\\theta$ (radians) for angular displacement, $\\omega = \\frac{\\Delta\\theta}{\\Delta t}$ for angular velocity, and $\\alpha = \\frac{\\Delta\\omega}{\\Delta t}$ for angular acceleration. Linear and angular quantities connect through the radius: $v = r\\omega$ for tangential speed and $a_t = r\\alpha$ for tangential acceleration. Centripetal acceleration ($a_c = \\frac{v^2}{r} = r\\omega^2$), directed toward the center, is required for any curved motion and changes only the direction of velocity. Period ($T$) and frequency ($f = 1/T$) provide time-based descriptions, with $\\omega = 2\\pi f$. In non-uniform circular motion, both centripetal and tangential accelerations act simultaneously. Understanding these kinematic relationships provides the foundation for analyzing the forces required for circular motion."
