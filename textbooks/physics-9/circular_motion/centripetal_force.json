  "topic": "6.2 Centripetal Force",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the force required for circular motion - centripetal force. Students will learn to identify the source of centripetal force in various situations, calculate the magnitude of centripetal force, and apply Newton's second law to circular motion problems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Centripetal force is the net force directed toward the center of a circular path that causes centripetal acceleration. It is not a new type of force but rather the name for the center-seeking component of existing forces.",
    "explanation": "Centripetal force is required for any object to move in a curved path. According to Newton's second law, $\\sum F = ma$, the net inward force must equal $\\frac{mv^2}{r}$ or $mr\\omega^2$ to produce the necessary centripetal acceleration."

  "summary": "Centripetal force is the net inward force required for circular motion, given by $F_c = m\\frac{v^2}{r} = mr\\omega^2$. It is not a separate force but rather the center-seeking component of real forces like tension, friction, normal force, or gravity. Newton's second law for circular motion states that the vector sum of radial forces must equal the centripetal force requirement. Key applications include: banked curves where the normal force provides centripetal force at the design speed ($\\tan\\theta = \\frac{v^2}{rg}$); vertical circular motion where gravity affects both speed and centripetal force; and orbital motion where gravity provides the centripetal force. Centrifugal force is a fictitious force that appears in rotating reference frames, balancing the real centripetal force to create apparent equilibrium. Understanding centripetal force enables the analysis and design of curves, orbits, rotating machinery, and many other circular motion systems."
