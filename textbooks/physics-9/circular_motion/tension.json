  "expanded_description": "This section examines how tension forces provide centripetal force in various circular motion scenarios. Students will learn to analyze objects moving in circles while connected by strings, ropes, or cables, and calculate tension forces throughout the motion.",

    "explanation": "When an object is constrained to move in a circular path by a connecting string, the tension force has both radial and tangential components that together determine the object's acceleration and the stress on the connecting material."

Conical pendulums involve both vertical ($T\\cos\\theta = mg$) and radial ($T\\sin\\theta = \\frac{mv^2}{r}$) components, with period $T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{L\\cos\\theta}{g}}$. Vertical circular motion exhibits dramatic tension variation: maximum at bottom ($T = m(g + \\frac{v^2}{r})$), minimum at top ($T = m(\\frac{v^2}{r} - g)$), with critical minimum speed $v_{min} = \\sqrt{rg}$ at the top for complete circles. Multiple-object systems share angular velocity but may have different linear speeds and tensions. Engineering applications require safety factors to account for dynamic loading, material imperfections, and fatigue. Understanding tension in circular motion is crucial for designing safe amusement rides, centrifuges, rotating space stations, and other rotating systems."
