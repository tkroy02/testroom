          "explanation": "Answer should include: Weightlessness occurs because both the station and astronauts are in free-fall with the same acceleration. They are continuously falling toward Earth but have sufficient tangential velocity to miss it, creating orbital motion. The sensation of weight comes from contact forces, which are absent in free-fall."

          "explanation": "Inertial frame: The horizontal component of the normal force provides exactly the required centripetal force. Rotating frame: The outward component of gravity (down the bank) balances the centrifugal force, creating equilibrium. Both perspectives show that friction is not required at the design speed."

          "process": "Question 6: Why is the tension maximum at the bottom and minimum at the top for a mass swinging in a vertical circle?",

At the top, tension and weight both act toward the center: $T = \\frac{mv^2}{r} - mg$. Additionally, speed is maximum at bottom (minimum PE) and minimum at top (maximum PE) due to energy conservation."
