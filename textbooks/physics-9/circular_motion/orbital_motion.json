  "expanded_description": "This section explores orbital motion, where gravity provides the centripetal force for celestial bodies to move in curved paths around each other. Students will learn the fundamental principles of orbital mechanics, including Kepler's laws and the physics of satellites.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Orbital motion occurs when gravity provides exactly the centripetal force needed for circular or elliptical motion. The balance between gravitational attraction and inertial motion creates stable orbits.",
    "explanation": "In orbital motion, objects are in continuous free-fall toward the central body, but their tangential velocity is sufficient that they 'miss' the planet and continue falling in a curved path, creating a stable orbit."

Kepler's three laws describe planetary motion: elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus, equal area sweeping in equal times, and the period-radius relationship $T^2 \\propto a^3$. The total orbital energy $E = -\\frac{GMm}{2r}$ for circular orbits is always negative for bound systems. Different orbit types (LEO, MEO, GEO) serve various purposes, with geostationary orbits at 35,786 km altitude having 24-hour periods. Orbital maneuvers use Hohmann transfers for efficient changes between circular orbits, requiring precise $\\Delta v$ applications at specific orbital positions. Understanding orbital mechanics enables satellite deployment, space exploration, and explains the motion of celestial bodies throughout the universe."
