  "summary": "The metric system, specifically the International System of Units (SI), provides a coherent, decimal-based framework for all scientific measurements. Built on seven base units—with meter (length), kilogram (mass), and second (time) being fundamental to physics—the system uses standardized prefixes (kilo-, centi-, milli-, micro-, etc.) to conveniently express quantities across enormous scale ranges. Derived units like Newton (force) and Joule (energy) maintain system coherence by combining base units according to physical relationships. Mastery of unit conversions through dimensional analysis ensures accuracy in calculations, while proper unit selection facilitates clear scientific communication. The metric system's decimal structure, worldwide standardization, and foundation in fundamental constants make it essential for precise, reproducible scientific work across all disciplines and scales, from subatomic particles to cosmological distances."
