  "summary": "Unit conversions are essential skills for working with measurements across different systems and contexts. The conversion factor method uses multiplication by fractions equal to 1 to systematically change units while preserving quantities. Metric prefix conversions leverage the decimal nature of SI units through simple multiplication by powers of 10. Metric-imperial conversions require specific memorized factors since the systems lack simple mathematical relationships. Compound unit conversions handle derived quantities by applying conversion factors to each dimension separately. Temperature conversions use formulas to account for different zero points and scale intervals between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Error prevention techniques including unit tracking, reasonableness checking, estimation, and multiple method verification ensure accuracy and build confidence. Mastering unit conversions enables flexible work with measurement data, proper interpretation of scientific information, and effective communication across different measurement traditions and professional fields."
