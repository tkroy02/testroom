  "summary": "The Chapter 2 test provides comprehensive assessment of measurement skills through multiple question formats targeting different cognitive levels. Knowledge questions ensure mastery of fundamental terminology, units, and concepts. Unit conversion problems test fluency with metric prefixes, dimensional analysis, and compound units across different measurement systems. Dimensional analysis questions evaluate the ability to verify equations and maintain unit consistency in physical relationships. Experimental design questions assess understanding of proper measurement techniques, procedure development, and error minimization strategies. Application problems test the ability to use measurement skills in realistic physics contexts including buoyancy, thermal expansion, and material identification. Error analysis questions ensure students can calculate uncertainties, propagate errors, and report results with appropriate significant figures. Together, these assessment types provide a complete evaluation of students' measurement literacy, problem-solving abilities, and readiness to apply measurement principles to laboratory work and advanced physics study. The test emphasizes not only what students know but, more importantly, how they apply measurement thinking to diverse scientific contexts."
