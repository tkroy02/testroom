  "summary": "Derived units extend the SI system by combining base units according to physical relationships, creating a coherent measurement framework where units naturally reflect underlying physical laws. Mechanical derived units like Newton (force), Joule (energy), and Watt (power) emerge from combinations of length, mass, and time. Electrical units such as Volt, Ohm, and Farad derive from mechanical units through electromagnetic relationships. Dimensional analysis provides powerful verification of equations and derivation of physical relationships through unit consistency checking. Practical applications range from simple force calculations to complex multi-step problems involving energy conversions and real-world contexts. Named derived units honor scientific contributors while providing convenient scales for common measurements. The systematic nature of derived units ensures dimensional consistency across all physics calculations, simplifies unit conversions, and maintains the decimal coherence of the metric system, making SI the preferred system for scientific work worldwide."
