  "summary": "Dimensional analysis is a powerful problem-solving technique that uses the fundamental dimensions of physical quantities (M, L, T for mechanics) to verify equations, derive relationships, and solve problems systematically. The principle of dimensional homogeneity requires that all terms in valid physical equations have consistent dimensions, providing an essential check for derived formulas. Dimensional analysis can predict the form of physical relationships up to dimensionless constants, as demonstrated in derivations of pendulum period, orbital motion, and wave speed formulas. It provides a systematic framework for complex unit conversions and helps set up and verify solutions to physics problems. However, dimensional analysis has limitations—it cannot determine dimensionless constants (like 2π), angular dependencies, or the form of transcendental functions. Advanced applications include the Buckingham π theorem for analyzing complex systems with multiple variables. Mastering dimensional analysis develops strong physical intuition and provides a valuable tool for checking work, deriving relationships, and understanding the fundamental structure of physical laws across all domains of physics."
