  "summary": "The seven SI base units—meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount), and candela (luminous intensity)—form the foundation of all physical measurements. Modern definitions since 2019 link these units directly to fundamental constants of nature: the meter to the speed of light, the second to cesium atom transitions, the kilogram to Planck's constant, and others to elementary charge, Boltzmann constant, and Avogadro constant. This constant-based system ensures universal reproducibility and long-term stability of measurement standards. The coherence of SI allows derived units to maintain simple relationships with base units through dimensional analysis. Precise realization of these units enables advanced technologies from GPS and telecommunications to nanotechnology and quantum computing, while supporting fundamental research across all physics disciplines. Understanding these base units and their definitions is essential for accurate measurement, proper unit manipulation, and appreciation of how modern metrology underpins scientific and technological progress."
