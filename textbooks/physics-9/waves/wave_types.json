  "summary": "Waves are fundamentally classified as transverse (particle motion perpendicular to propagation) or longitudinal (particle motion parallel to propagation). Transverse waves exhibit crests and troughs, can be polarized, and include electromagnetic waves (light, radio) and waves on strings. Longitudinal waves feature compressions and rarefactions, cannot be polarized, and include sound waves and seismic P-waves. Surface waves like ocean waves combine both motion types with elliptical particle paths. Wave speed depends on medium properties: transverse mechanical waves depend on tension and density ($v = \\sqrt{T/\\mu}$), longitudinal sound waves depend on bulk modulus and density ($v = \\sqrt{B/\\rho}$), while electromagnetic waves have fixed speed in vacuum ($c = 3.00\\times 10^8\\,m/s$). The wave type determines possible applications: transverse waves enable polarization-based technologies, while longitudinal waves are essential for sound transmission and seismic analysis. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for analyzing wave behavior in various physical contexts from communications to earth sciences."
