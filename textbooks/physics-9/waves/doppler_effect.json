  "expanded_description": "This section explores the Doppler Effect - the change in observed frequency and wavelength of a wave due to relative motion between the source and observer. Students will learn to calculate frequency shifts for sound and light waves and understand the applications in various scientific and technological fields.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When a wave source and observer are in relative motion, the observed frequency differs from the emitted frequency. The observer detects a higher frequency when approaching the source and a lower frequency when receding.",
    "explanation": "The Doppler Effect occurs because motion changes the effective spacing between wavefronts reaching the observer. For approaching motion, wavefronts are compressed (higher frequency, shorter wavelength); for receding motion, wavefronts are stretched (lower frequency, longer wavelength)."

  "summary": "The Doppler Effect is the change in observed frequency due to relative motion between source and observer. For sound waves, different formulas apply depending on whether the source or observer is moving: moving source $f' = f\\frac{v}{v \\mp v_s}$, moving observer $f' = f\\frac{v \\pm v_o}{v}$. For light waves, the relativistic formula $f' = f\\sqrt{\\frac{1 \\pm \\beta}{1 \\mp \\beta}}$ applies, with $\\beta = v/c$. Approaching motion causes frequency increase (blueshift for light, higher pitch for sound); receding motion causes frequency decrease (redshift for light, lower pitch for sound). Applications include police radar ($\\Delta f = 2f\\frac{v}{c}$), medical ultrasound for blood flow measurement, weather radar for storm tracking, and astronomical redshift measurements for determining cosmic velocities. The Doppler Effect demonstrates fundamental wave behavior and enables precise velocity measurements across many scientific and technological fields."
