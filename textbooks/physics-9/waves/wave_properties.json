Additional descriptors include wave number ($k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$) for spatial frequency and phase for position within the oscillation cycle. These properties are interrelated: for a given medium (fixed $v$), frequency and wavelength are inversely proportional, while amplitude can vary independently. Understanding these relationships enables prediction of wave behavior, analysis of interference phenomena, and design of wave-based technologies across the electromagnetic and mechanical spectrum."
