  "summary": "This review section encapsulates the entire journey of a sound wave, from its physical generation as a longitudinal pressure wave governed by $v = fλ$, through its perceptual properties of pitch (frequency), loudness (intensity/amplitude), and timbre (waveform/harmonics). It covers the Doppler effect's role in frequency shift due to relative motion and concludes with the biological marvel of the human ear, which collects, amplifies, transduces, and analyzes sound through the coordinated function of the outer, middle, and inner ear (cochlea), ultimately sending tonotopically organized signals to the brain. Mastery of these questions demonstrates a unified understanding of wave physics and auditory biology."
