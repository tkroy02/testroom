    "principle": "Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave consisting of pressure variations that propagate through elastic media. It requires a medium for transmission and is characterized by compressions and rarefactions of the medium particles.",

  "summary": "Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave consisting of pressure variations (compressions and rarefactions) that propagate through elastic media. It requires a material medium and cannot travel through vacuum. Key characteristics include frequency (20-20,000 Hz for human hearing, determining pitch), amplitude (determining loudness), and wavelength ($\\lambda = v/f$). Sound speed depends on medium properties: $v = \\sqrt{B/\\rho}$ in fluids, $v = \\sqrt{Y/\\rho}$ in solids, and $v = \\sqrt{\\gamma RT/M}$ in gases (343 m/s in air at 20°C). Sound intensity follows inverse square law with distance and is measured in decibels ($\\beta = 10\\log_{10}(I/I_0)$ dB). Sound exhibits wave phenomena including reflection (echoes), refraction, diffraction, and interference. Musical sounds have harmonic frequency relationships while noise has random waveforms. Applications include audio technology, medical ultrasound, sonar, and architectural acoustics. Understanding sound wave properties enables both technological applications and analysis of natural auditory phenomena."
