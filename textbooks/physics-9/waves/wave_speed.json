  "summary": "Wave speed is determined by medium properties and connects frequency and wavelength through $v = f\\lambda$. For mechanical waves: string waves depend on tension and linear density ($v = \\sqrt{T/\\mu}$); sound waves depend on elastic modulus and density ($v = \\sqrt{Y/\\rho}$ in solids, $v = \\sqrt{B/\\rho}$ in fluids); sound in gases increases with temperature ($v = \\sqrt{\\gamma RT/M}$). Electromagnetic waves travel at $c = 3.00\\times 10^8\\,m/s$ in vacuum and slower in materials ($v = c/n$). Wave speed can be frequency-dependent (dispersion), causing different colors of light or ocean wave frequencies to travel at different speeds. Measurement techniques include time-of-flight, resonance methods, and interferometry. Understanding wave speed is crucial for designing musical instruments, communication systems, medical imaging devices, and analyzing seismic data. The fundamental relationship between wave speed, frequency, and wavelength applies universally across all wave types and media."
