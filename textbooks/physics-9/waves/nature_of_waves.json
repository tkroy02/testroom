  "summary": "Waves are disturbances that transfer energy through space or media without permanent displacement of matter. They are classified as transverse (particle motion perpendicular to propagation, e.g., light), longitudinal (particle motion parallel to propagation, e.g., sound), or surface waves (combination). Mechanical waves require a physical medium, while electromagnetic waves can propagate through vacuum. Key wave parameters include amplitude ($A$), wavelength ($\\lambda$), frequency ($f$), period ($T$), and wave speed ($v = f\\lambda$). Sinusoidal waves are described mathematically by $y(x,t) = A\\sin(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)$ where $k = 2\\pi/\\lambda$ is wave number and $\\omega = 2\\pi f$ is angular frequency. Wave energy is proportional to amplitude squared ($E \\propto A^2$). Waves exhibit unique behaviors including superposition (waves add when they meet), interference, reflection, refraction, and diffraction. Wave speed depends on medium properties: string waves $v = \\sqrt{T/\\mu}$, sound in air $v = \\sqrt{\\gamma RT/M}$. Understanding these fundamental wave properties provides the foundation for studying more complex wave phenomena in physics, engineering, and technology."
