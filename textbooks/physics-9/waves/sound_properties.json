  "expanded_description": "This section explores the three fundamental perceptual properties of sound: pitch, loudness, and quality (timbre). Students will learn how these subjective experiences relate to objective physical measurements and understand what makes different sounds distinguishable.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The three primary perceptual properties of sound are pitch (related to frequency), loudness (related to intensity), and quality or timbre (related to harmonic content and waveform shape). These subjective experiences have precise physical correlates.",
    "explanation": "While pitch, loudness, and quality are psychological perceptions, they correspond directly to measurable physical properties: frequency, intensity, and harmonic spectrum. Understanding these relationships explains why we can distinguish different instruments playing the same note at the same volume."

  "summary": "Sound has three primary perceptual properties with precise physical correlates: Pitch is primarily determined by fundamental frequency, with human perception ranging from 20-20,000 Hz and following approximately logarithmic scaling (musical intervals based on frequency ratios). Loudness relates to sound intensity measured in decibels ($\\beta = 10\\log_{10}(I/I_0)$ dB), with perception following Stevens' Power Law and varying with frequency (Fletcher-Munson curves). Quality or timbre depends on harmonic content (relative amplitudes of fundamental and overtones), waveform shape, and temporal envelope (ADSR - Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release). Human perception involves complex psychoacoustic phenomena including frequency masking, critical bands, and non-linear loudness perception. Understanding these properties enables audio engineering, musical instrument design, speech processing, and hearing technology. The relationship between physical measurements and subjective perception explains why we can distinguish countless different sounds and why audio manipulation requires understanding both physics and human hearing."
