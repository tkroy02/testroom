  "topic": "5.2 Energy and Kinetic Energy",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces energy as a central, conserved quantity in physics and focuses specifically on kinetic energy—the energy of motion. Students will learn to calculate kinetic energy, understand its scalar nature, and explore the profound connection between net work and kinetic energy change established by the Work-Energy Theorem.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Energy is the capacity to do work. Kinetic Energy (KE) is the energy an object possesses due to its motion. The net work done on an object is quantitatively equal to the change in its kinetic energy.",
    "explanation": "Kinetic energy provides a powerful alternative to Newton's laws for analyzing motion. Instead of tracking forces and accelerations over time, we can use the Work-Energy Theorem to relate the total effect of all forces (the net work) directly to the change in an object's speed."

  "summary": "Kinetic Energy (KE = ½mv²) is the energy of motion, a scalar quantity measured in Joules that depends on both mass and the square of speed. The Work-Energy Theorem (W_net = ΔKE) establishes a fundamental connection: the net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy. This theorem provides a powerful problem-solving tool that often simplifies the analysis of motion, especially for complex paths or variable forces. Kinetic energy is additive for systems of particles, and external work can increase both the center-of-mass kinetic energy and internal kinetic energy. While KE = ½mv² is extremely accurate for everyday speeds, it breaks down at relativistic speeds approaching light, where a more complex formula is required. Understanding kinetic energy and its relationship to work lays the essential foundation for the broader concept of energy conservation."
