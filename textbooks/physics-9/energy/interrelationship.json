  "topic": "5.5 Work, Energy, and Power",
  "expanded_description": "This section synthesizes the concepts of work, energy, and power into a unified framework. Students will learn to trace the flow of energy through a system, use work as the mechanism for energy transfer, and understand power as the rate of this process. This integrated perspective is crucial for solving complex, real-world problems across various fields of physics and engineering.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Work is the mechanism of energy transfer, energy is the conserved quantity that is transferred, and power is the rate at which this transfer occurs. These three concepts are fundamentally interconnected.",
    "explanation": "This trio forms a complete story: Energy is the 'currency,' work is the 'transaction' that spends or gains this currency, and power measures how 'quickly' the transaction happens. Understanding their relationship allows for a dynamic analysis of physical systems."

  "summary": "Work, energy, and power form an inseparable triad in physics. Work (W = F•d) is the process of energy transfer, the Work-Energy Theorem (W_net = ΔKE) quantifies this for kinetic energy, and the conservation of energy law (including potential energy and non-conservative work) tracks the total energy. Power (P = W/Δt = F•v) measures the rate of this energy transfer or the rate at which work is done. In real-world applications, efficiency measures the fraction of input energy converted to useful work, as some energy is always degraded into less useful forms like heat. This unified framework provides a powerful and versatile set of tools for analyzing everything from simple machines to complex biological and industrial systems, allowing problem-solvers to choose the most efficient conceptual path—be it force, work, energy, or power—to a solution."
