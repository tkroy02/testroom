  "expanded_description": "This section unifies the concepts of work, kinetic energy, and potential energy into the fundamental principle of energy conservation. Students will learn to apply the law of conservation of energy to solve complex problems in mechanics, track energy transformations between different forms, and account for energy dissipation by non-conservative forces.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The total energy in an isolated system is constant. Energy can be transformed from one form to another (e.g., kinetic to potential, mechanical to thermal), but it cannot be created or destroyed.",
    "explanation": "This is one of the most powerful and universal laws in all of physics. It provides a method to analyze systems that would be very difficult using Newton's laws alone, by focusing on the total energy before and after a process, regardless of the complex details in between."

  "summary": "The Law of Conservation of Energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another or transferred between systems. For mechanical systems where only conservative forces act (gravity, springs), mechanical energy (KE + PE) is conserved, providing a powerful problem-solving tool. In real-world systems, non-conservative forces like friction are present, doing work (W_nc) that transforms mechanical energy into other forms like thermal energy, sound, or light. The general law is expressed as KE_i + PE_i + W_nc = KE_f + PE_f, where a negative W_nc indicates mechanical energy loss. This principle is universal, applying beyond mechanics to chemical, nuclear, and biological processes. Power quantifies the rate at which these energy transfers and transformations occur. Understanding energy conservation allows for the analysis of complex systems by focusing on the total energy content before and after a process, often simplifying calculations that would be intractable using force-based methods alone."
