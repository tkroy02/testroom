  "topic": "5.3 Potential Energy",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces potential energy as stored energy associated with the position or configuration of a system. Students will learn to identify different forms of potential energy, calculate them in various situations, and understand the fundamental concept of conservative forces, which are prerequisites for the law of conservation of mechanical energy.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Potential Energy (PE) is energy stored in a system due to the relative positions or configurations of objects. This stored energy has the potential to be converted into kinetic energy or other forms. The work done by a conservative force is independent of path and can be expressed as a change in potential energy.",
    "explanation": "Potential energy represents 'positional energy.' It is not a property of a single object but of a system of interacting objects (e.g., the Earth-object system for gravity). The change in potential energy is defined as the negative of the work done by the associated conservative force: ΔPE = -W_cons."

      "introduction": "Potential energy is a way of accounting for the work that a conservative force *can* do. When you lift an object, you do work against gravity, storing energy that can be released later as kinetic energy.",

        "definition": "Potential Energy (PE): Stored energy associated with the position or configuration of a system.\nDefining Relationship: ΔPE = -W_cons\nSI Unit: Joule (J)\nScalar Quantity\nKey Idea: Only changes in potential energy are physically meaningful; the zero point is arbitrary.",
        "context": "Potential energy exists only for conservative forces. It is a system property—for gravitational potential energy near Earth's surface, the system is the object AND the Earth."

  "summary": "Potential energy is stored energy associated with the configuration of a system interacting via conservative forces. The two most common forms are gravitational potential energy (PE_grav = mgh for local gravity) and elastic potential energy (PE_elastic = ½kx² for springs). The change in potential energy is defined as the negative of the work done by the associated conservative force (ΔPE = -W_cons). Crucially, potential energy is a property of a system, not a single object. Only conservative forces, which are path-independent and have zero net work over a closed loop, have associated potential energy functions. Non-conservative forces like friction dissipate energy and cannot store it. The connection between force and potential energy is fundamental: the conservative force is the negative derivative of the potential energy function (F = -d(PE)/dx), pointing in the direction that decreases potential energy. Understanding potential energy is the final piece needed to state the powerful Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy."
