  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the concept of work as the transfer of energy through the application of force. Students will learn to calculate work done by forces, understand when work is positive or negative, and recognize the relationship between work and energy transfer in physical systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Work is done when a force causes displacement, transferring energy to or from an object. The amount of work depends on the force magnitude, displacement magnitude, and the angle between the force and displacement directions.",
    "explanation": "Work represents the bridge between forces (dynamics) and energy (energetics). When work is done on an object, energy is transferred, changing the object's kinetic or potential energy."

  "summary": "Work is the transfer of energy that occurs when a force acts through a displacement, calculated as W = Fd cosθ where θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors. Work can be positive (energy added to object), negative (energy removed from object), or zero (no energy transfer). Different force types have characteristic work patterns: gravity does work only during vertical motion, friction always does negative work, and springs do work that depends quadratically on displacement. The net work done on an object equals the sum of work from all individual forces and equals the change in kinetic energy (Work-Energy Theorem). Graphically, work corresponds to the area under a force-displacement curve. Power measures how quickly work is done (P = W/t) and relates to force and velocity through P = F·v. Understanding work provides the crucial connection between force analysis and energy concepts, enabling prediction of motion changes through energy considerations rather than detailed force analysis."
