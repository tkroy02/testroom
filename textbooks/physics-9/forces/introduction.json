  "summary": "Forces are pushes or pulls that can cause objects to accelerate, change direction, or deform. As vector quantities, forces have both magnitude (measured in Newtons) and direction. Common force types include gravity (weight), normal force (surface support), friction (motion opposition), tension (rope pulls), and applied forces (direct contact). Free-body diagrams provide systematic visualization of all forces acting on an object, which is essential for analyzing motion. The net force - the vector sum of all forces - determines acceleration through Newton's second law. Forces can cause various effects: balanced forces maintain equilibrium (constant velocity or rest), while unbalanced forces cause acceleration. Understanding forces connects the description of motion (kinematics) with its causes (dynamics), forming the foundation for analyzing everything from everyday activities to complex mechanical systems."
