  "expanded_description": "This section explores gravitational forces, focusing on weight as the force of gravity acting on objects. Students will learn to calculate weight, understand the distinction between mass and weight, and analyze how gravity affects motion both on Earth and in various gravitational environments.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Weight is the gravitational force exerted on an object by a celestial body, calculated as W = mg, where mass measures inertia and weight measures gravitational attraction. The acceleration due to gravity (g) depends on location and planetary characteristics.",
    "explanation": "Gravity is a fundamental force that acts at a distance, causing all objects with mass to attract each other. Near Earth's surface, this results in a nearly constant downward acceleration of 9.8 m/s² for all objects regardless of mass."

  "summary": "Weight is the gravitational force acting on an object, calculated as W = mg, where mass measures inertia and g is the gravitational acceleration. The key distinction is that mass is constant everywhere, while weight depends on location and gravitational field strength. Near Earth's surface, g ≈ 9.8 m/s², causing all objects to accelerate equally during free fall (neglecting air resistance). Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, F = G(m₁m₂)/r², describes the fundamental attractive force between all masses. Weight can appear to change in accelerating reference frames (elevators, spacecraft) or different gravitational environments (other planets), though mass remains invariant. Understanding gravitational concepts enables analysis of diverse phenomena from everyday weight measurements to orbital mechanics and planetary exploration. Mastery of weight and gravity principles provides the foundation for analyzing motion under gravitational influence and understanding fundamental force interactions in the universe."
