  "topic": "4.6 Newton's Third Law",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores Newton's Third Law of Motion, which describes how forces always occur in equal and opposite pairs between interacting objects. Students will learn to identify action-reaction pairs, understand why these pairs don't cancel each other, and apply this principle to analyze force interactions in various physical systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. When one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object simultaneously exerts a force equal in magnitude and opposite in direction on the first object.",
    "explanation": "Newton's Third Law reveals that forces are always interactions between two objects - there are no isolated forces. The action and reaction forces act on different objects, which is why they don't cancel each other."

  "summary": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. These force pairs always involve two different objects interacting with each other, and the forces occur simultaneously. The key insight is that action and reaction forces act on different objects, which is why they don't cancel each other when calculating net force on a single object. Proper identification requires specifying exactly which object exerts force on which other object. Applications range from simple daily activities like walking and sitting to complex mechanical systems with multiple connected objects. Common misconceptions include confusing Third Law pairs with balanced forces on single objects, believing stronger objects exert greater forces, or thinking action-reaction prevents motion. Mastering Newton's Third Law enables accurate analysis of force interactions in multi-object systems and provides the foundation for understanding how forces transmit through mechanical connections and constraints."
