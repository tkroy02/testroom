  "summary": "Free-body diagrams are essential visualization tools that represent all forces acting on a single object through vector arrows. Systematic construction involves isolating the object, identifying all external forces, determining their directions, drawing vectors with appropriate lengths and labels, and selecting an optimal coordinate system. Common force types include weight (always downward), normal force (perpendicular to surfaces), friction (parallel to surfaces opposing motion), tension (along ropes/cables), and applied forces. Strategic coordinate system selection, such as tilted coordinates for inclined planes or radial-tangential for circular motion, can significantly simplify calculations. These diagrams serve as the foundation for applying Newton's laws systematically, transforming complex physical situations into solvable mathematical problems. Mastery of free-body diagrams enables accurate force analysis across diverse scenarios from simple static equilibrium to complex dynamic systems with multiple objects and constraints."
