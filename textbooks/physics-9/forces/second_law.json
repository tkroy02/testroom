  "summary": "Newton's Second Law, expressed as F_net = ma, provides the fundamental quantitative relationship between force, mass, and acceleration. The law states that acceleration is directly proportional to net force and inversely proportional to mass, with acceleration occurring in the same direction as the net force. This vector relationship applies component-wise, enabling analysis of multi-dimensional motion. Practical applications range from calculating vehicle acceleration to analyzing forces in complex mechanical systems. A crucial distinction exists between mass (measure of inertia, constant) and weight (gravitational force, depends on location). While Newton's Second Law is remarkably accurate for everyday situations, it has limitations at relativistic speeds, with variable mass systems, and in non-inertial reference frames. Mastering this law enables prediction of motion from forces and calculation of required forces for desired motions, forming the cornerstone of classical mechanics and engineering dynamics."
