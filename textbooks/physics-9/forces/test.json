Knowledge questions ensure mastery of fundamental terminology, concepts, and Newton's laws. Free-body diagram questions evaluate the ability to interpret and construct force diagrams, extract motion information from vector representations, and analyze multi-object systems. Newton's laws applications test procedural fluency in solving dynamics problems involving equilibrium, acceleration, friction, and circular motion. Conceptual questions assess deeper understanding of force principles and the ability to articulate relationships beyond mathematical computations. Experimental design questions evaluate understanding of force measurement techniques and the ability to design valid investigations. Integrated problems challenge students to synthesize multiple force concepts in complex, realistic scenarios. Together, these assessment types provide a complete evaluation of students' dynamics literacy, problem-solving abilities, and readiness to apply force concepts to advanced mechanics and real-world physics applications."
