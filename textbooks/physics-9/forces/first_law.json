  "expanded_description": "This section explores Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia. Students will learn about inertia, the tendency of objects to resist changes in motion, and understand the conditions under which objects maintain constant velocity.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law establishes the fundamental principle of inertia - that objects naturally maintain their state of motion unless forces cause them to change. This law defines the natural state of motion and introduces the concept of inertial reference frames."

      "introduction": "Inertia is the property of matter that resists changes in motion. The more mass an object has, the greater its inertia and the more force required to change its motion.",

        "context": "Inertia explains why objects don't spontaneously start moving, stop moving, or change direction without a cause - there must be a net force acting."

  "summary": "Newton's First Law, the Law of Inertia, states that objects maintain their state of motion (whether at rest or moving with constant velocity) unless acted upon by an unbalanced net force. Inertia is the property of matter that resists changes in motion, quantitatively measured by mass. This law defines inertial reference frames - coordinate systems where the law holds true. Practical applications range from vehicle safety systems (seat belts, airbags) to space mission planning, where inertia dominates in the absence of significant forces. Common misconceptions often arise from everyday experiences with friction, leading to the incorrect belief that force is needed to maintain motion rather than to overcome resistance. Historically, this law represented a revolutionary departure from Aristotelian physics, with Galileo's experiments providing the foundation for Newton's formal statement. Understanding Newton's First Law is crucial for analyzing motion causes and provides the conceptual bridge to Newton's Second Law, which quantifies how forces change motion."
