  "summary": "Net force is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object, calculated through vector addition methods including graphical tip-to-tail, component resolution, and Pythagorean theorem for perpendicular forces. The net force determines an object's acceleration: zero net force results in equilibrium (constant velocity or rest), while non-zero net force causes acceleration in the direction of the net force. Free-body diagrams provide essential visualization for identifying all forces and determining net force. Practical applications span vehicle dynamics, sports analysis, and engineering design, where understanding net forces enables motion prediction and structural safety. Systematic problem-solving approaches ensure accurate net force calculation through proper force identification, component resolution, and physical verification. Mastering net force concepts provides the crucial link between force analysis and motion prediction, forming the foundation for applying Newton's Second Law (F_net = ma) to real-world dynamics problems."
