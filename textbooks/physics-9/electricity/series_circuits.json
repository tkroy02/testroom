  "summary": "Series circuits feature components connected in a single path, resulting in constant current throughout the circuit. The equivalent resistance equals the sum of all individual resistances (R_eq = R₁ + R₂ + R₃ + ⋯), while voltage divides across components in proportion to their resistance (V_n = V_total × R_n/R_eq). Power distribution follows P = I²R, making higher-resistance components dissipate more power. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law requires that the sum of all voltage drops equals the source voltage. Practical applications include voltage dividers, current limiting circuits, and series battery configurations. However, series circuits suffer from single-point failure—if one component fails, the entire circuit stops working. Analysis follows systematic methods: calculate equivalent resistance, determine total current, then find individual voltages and powers. Experimental verification confirms constant current measurements and proper voltage division. Common errors include assuming equal voltage drops, incorrect resistance calculations, and overlooking the implications of constant current for power distribution. Understanding series circuits provides the foundation for analyzing more complex circuit configurations and demonstrates fundamental principles of circuit theory."
