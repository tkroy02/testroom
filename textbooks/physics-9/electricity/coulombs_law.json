The force acts along the line joining the charges, with like charges repelling and opposite charges attracting. The Coulomb constant k = 8.99 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² reflects the strength of electrostatic interactions, which are vastly stronger than gravitational forces at small scales. The law applies exactly to point charges and spherically symmetric distributions, with the superposition principle allowing calculation of net forces in multi-charge systems through vector addition. Coulomb's careful torsion balance experiments first verified this inverse-square relationship, which remains one of physics' most precisely confirmed laws. Applications range from atomic physics—where Coulomb forces determine atomic structure—to engineering problems involving charged particle systems. The vector nature of electrostatic forces requires component methods for complex configurations, while dielectric materials reduce forces through polarization effects. Coulomb's Law forms the foundation for all of electrostatics and much of electromagnetic theory."
