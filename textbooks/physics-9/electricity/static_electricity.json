  "topic": "10.1 Introduction to Static Electricity",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces static electricity as stationary electric charges that build up on the surface of objects. Students will learn about charge separation, conservation of charge, and the fundamental principles of electrostatics through everyday phenomena like shocks from doorknobs and clothes clinging from the dryer.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Static electricity involves the buildup of stationary electric charges on objects through the transfer of electrons, governed by the conservation of charge and the fundamental rule that like charges repel while opposite charges attract.",
    "explanation": "When two different materials rub together, electrons can transfer from one material to another, creating an imbalance of charge. This imbalance creates electric forces that can cause objects to attract or repel each other, or even produce sparks when the charge becomes large enough to jump through air."

  "summary": "Static electricity involves the buildup of stationary electric charges through electron transfer between materials. Charge comes in two types (positive and negative) with the fundamental rule that like charges repel and opposite charges attract. The triboelectric series predicts which materials gain or lose electrons when rubbed together. Charge is conserved in all processes—it cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred. Conductors allow free electron movement, while insulators localize charges. Coulomb's Law quantitatively describes the force between charges: F = k|q₁q₂|/r². Polarization occurs when external charges cause charge redistribution in neutral objects. Everyday phenomena like static shocks and clothing cling demonstrate these principles, while applications include photocopiers and electrostatic precipitators. Electric fields represent the force per unit charge in space, with field lines visually showing field direction and strength. Understanding static electricity provides the foundation for all electrical phenomena and technologies."
