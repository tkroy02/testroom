  "expanded_description": "This section explores electrostatic induction, the process of charging objects without direct contact by redistributing their internal charges through the influence of an external electric field. Students will learn the step-by-step mechanisms of induction charging and its applications in everyday phenomena and technologies.",
  "core_concept": {

  "summary": "Electrostatic induction is the process of charging objects without physical contact by using the electric field influence of a nearby charged object to redistribute electrons within conductors. The fundamental mechanism involves bringing a charged object near a neutral conductor, causing mobile electrons to move away from like charges and toward opposite charges, creating regions of induced charge while maintaining overall neutrality. Temporary induction produces charge separation only while the external field is present, while permanent charging by induction involves grounding during polarization to trap net charge. Conductors allow full electron mobility and macroscopic charge separation, while insulators only permit atomic-scale polarization. Electroscopes utilize induction to detect and identify charges, and applications range from photocopiers to electrostatic precipitators. Important phenomena include electrostatic shielding in Faraday cages and capacitor operation. Induction always demonstrates charge conservation—no new charges are created, only redistributed—and typically produces net attractive forces between the inducing object and induced conductor due to the inverse-square dependence of Coulomb's Law."
