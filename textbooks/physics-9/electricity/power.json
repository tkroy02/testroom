  "summary": "Electric power (P = IV) quantifies the rate of electrical energy conversion, with equivalent forms P = I²R and P = V²/R derived from Ohm's Law. In series circuits, power distribution is proportional to resistance with constant current, while in parallel circuits, smaller resistances consume more power at constant voltage. Energy consumption is measured in kilowatt-hours (1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J), enabling cost calculations based on usage time and local electricity rates. Device power ratings determine operational limits and safety requirements, with efficiency calculations revealing how much input power converts to useful work versus waste heat. AC power calculations use RMS values and must consider power factor for inductive loads. Practical applications include circuit protection sizing, wire selection, and energy-efficient design. High-voltage power transmission minimizes I²R losses over long distances, while proper component ratings prevent overheating and ensure safety. Understanding electric power relationships is essential for both theoretical circuit analysis and practical electrical system design, energy conservation, and cost management."
