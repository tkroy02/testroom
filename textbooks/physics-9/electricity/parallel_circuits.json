  "summary": "Parallel circuits feature components connected across common points, resulting in constant voltage across all branches. The equivalent resistance follows the reciprocal formula 1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + 1/R₃ + ⋯, always producing a total resistance less than the smallest branch resistance. Current divides among branches in inverse proportion to their resistance, with smaller resistances carrying larger currents. Power distribution follows P = V²/R, making lower-resistance components dissipate more power. Kirchhoff's Current Law requires that the sum of all branch currents equals the total current. Practical applications dominate electrical systems due to independent operation—household wiring, automotive systems, and electronic devices all use parallel configurations for reliability and flexibility. Analysis follows systematic methods: identify parallel branches, use constant voltage, calculate branch currents, then verify using conservation principles. Experimental verification confirms constant voltage measurements and proper current division. Common errors include assuming equal currents, incorrect resistance calculations, and overlooking the implications of constant voltage for power distribution. Understanding parallel circuits is essential for designing and analyzing practical electrical systems where device independence and reliability are critical."
