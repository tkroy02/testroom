  "summary": "Ohm's Law (V = IR) establishes the fundamental relationship between voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits. Voltage represents electrical potential difference (the driving force), current is the rate of charge flow, and resistance quantifies opposition to current. The law applies perfectly to ohmic materials like most metals, which maintain constant resistance and produce linear I-V characteristics. Resistance arises microscopically from electron collisions with atomic lattices and depends on material resistivity (ρ), length (L), and cross-sectional area (A) through R = ρL/A. Non-ohmic devices like diodes and incandescent bulbs deviate from this linear relationship. Practical applications include circuit analysis, voltage dividers, current limiting for LEDs, and power calculations (P = IV = I²R = V²/R). Experimental verification involves measuring I-V relationships and obtaining straight-line graphs for ohmic materials. While foundational, Ohm's Law has limitations—it doesn't apply to all materials, and understanding requires distinguishing between voltage as the cause of current and resistance as the limiting factor. Mastery of Ohm's Law provides the essential foundation for analyzing both simple and complex electrical systems."
