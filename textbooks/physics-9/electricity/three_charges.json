  "expanded_description": "This section extends Coulomb's Law to systems with three or more charges, focusing on the superposition principle and vector addition methods. Students will learn to calculate net electrostatic forces in multi-charge systems, handle complex geometries, and solve equilibrium problems involving multiple interacting charges.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The net electrostatic force on any charge in a multi-charge system equals the vector sum of all individual Coulomb forces from every other charge, with each pair interaction calculated independently using Coulomb's Law.",
    "explanation": "When multiple charges interact, the superposition principle allows us to treat each pair interaction separately and then combine them vectorially. This approach works because electrostatic forces obey linear superposition—the presence of other charges doesn't alter the fundamental Coulomb interaction between any two charges."

The component method—resolving each force into x and y components, summing components separately, then recombining—provides the systematic approach for calculations. Collinear charge systems allow scalar addition with careful attention to direction signs, while two-dimensional configurations require full vector analysis using trigonometry and coordinate geometry. Equilibrium problems involve finding positions where the vector sum of forces equals zero, with stability considerations showing that like-charge systems generally have unstable equilibrium. Problem-solving strategies emphasize organized approaches: drawing diagrams, calculating pair interactions separately, using consistent coordinate systems, and verifying physical reasonableness. Advanced configurations exploit symmetry and scaling relationships, while real-world applications span atomic physics, molecular interactions, and electrostatic device design. Mastering multi-charge force calculations requires understanding both the mathematical framework of vector addition and the physical principles governing charge interactions in complex systems."
