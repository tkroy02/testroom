  "summary": "Uniform motion describes movement with constant velocity, where objects maintain both constant speed and constant direction along a straight path. This simplest form of motion is characterized by zero acceleration and follows the linear relationship x = x₀ + vt between position and time. Graphically, uniform motion appears as straight lines on position-time graphs (slope = velocity) and horizontal lines on velocity-time graphs. The concept of relative motion allows analysis from different reference frames, with relative velocities remaining constant. Practical applications span transportation planning, safety calculations, industrial processes, and navigation systems. Uniform motion serves as the foundational case in kinematics, providing the basis for understanding more complex accelerated motions and illustrating Newton's first law - objects in motion remain in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net force. Mastering uniform motion analysis develops essential problem-solving skills and physical intuition that transfer to all areas of mechanics."
