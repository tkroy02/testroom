  "summary": "Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, a vector quantity that describes how quickly motion changes. It occurs whenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, with positive acceleration increasing speed and negative acceleration (deceleration) decreasing speed when considering motion along a straight line. Constant acceleration enables precise mathematical description through kinematic equations that relate position, velocity, acceleration, and time. Centripetal acceleration specifically describes the acceleration toward the center that occurs in circular motion due to continuous direction changes. Practical applications range from vehicle performance analysis to safety systems and everyday motion experiences. Understanding acceleration provides the crucial link between kinematics (motion description) and dynamics (motion causes), setting the foundation for studying forces through Newton's second law (F = ma)."
