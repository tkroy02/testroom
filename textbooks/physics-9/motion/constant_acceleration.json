  "summary": "Motion with constant acceleration follows predictable mathematical patterns described by four key kinematic equations that relate position, velocity, acceleration, and time. Free fall near Earth's surface provides the most important example, with all objects accelerating downward at approximately 9.8 m/s² regardless of mass when air resistance is negligible. Graphical representations show characteristic patterns: parabolic position-time curves, linear velocity-time graphs with slope equal to acceleration, and horizontal acceleration-time lines. Problem-solving requires systematic approaches with consistent sign conventions and unit management. Practical applications span vehicle dynamics, sports analysis, elevator motion, and safety calculations. While constant acceleration provides excellent approximations for many real-world scenarios, limitations arise with air resistance, variable forces, and complex motion patterns where acceleration changes. Mastering constant acceleration motion provides the foundation for understanding more complex dynamics and connects kinematics to the forces that cause acceleration through Newton's second law."
