  "summary": "Speed and velocity are fundamental concepts for quantifying motion, with speed measuring how fast an object moves (scalar) and velocity measuring both how fast and in what direction (vector). Average values describe overall motion characteristics over time intervals, while instantaneous values describe motion at specific moments. The crucial distinction lies in velocity's directional component, making |velocity| ≤ speed always, with equality only when motion maintains constant direction. Constant velocity indicates uniform straight-line motion, while changing velocity indicates acceleration, which can occur through speed changes, direction changes, or both. Practical applications range from vehicle navigation to sports analysis, with relative velocity concepts essential for understanding motion from different reference frames. Mastering these concepts enables accurate motion description, prediction of future positions, and sets the foundation for studying accelerated motion and the forces that cause velocity changes."
