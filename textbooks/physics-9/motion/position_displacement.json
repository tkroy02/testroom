  "summary": "Position, displacement, and distance are fundamental concepts for describing motion, each providing distinct but complementary information. Position specifies location relative to a reference point and requires a defined coordinate system. Displacement measures the change in position as a vector quantity, depending only on initial and final positions regardless of the path taken. Distance measures the total path length traveled as a scalar quantity, always positive and path-dependent. The crucial distinction lies in displacement being a vector (magnitude and direction) while distance is a scalar (magnitude only), with distance always being greater than or equal to displacement magnitude. In multi-dimensional motion, vector mathematics using components enables precise analysis of displacement. Understanding these concepts and their relationships provides the foundation for analyzing motion patterns, calculating velocities, and solving real-world navigation and tracking problems across physics, engineering, and everyday applications."
