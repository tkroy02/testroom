  "summary": "Effective physics problem solving employs a systematic framework that begins with thorough problem understanding and visualization, proceeds through strategic principle selection and mathematical execution, and concludes with rigorous verification of results. Different physics domains require specialized approaches: force problems use free-body diagrams and Newton's laws, energy problems apply conservation principles, and circuit problems utilize equivalent resistance and Kirchhoff's laws. Mathematical proficiency in algebra, trigonometry, and vector analysis is essential for solution execution. Verification techniques including unit analysis, limiting case testing, and order-of-magnitude estimation ensure solution correctness and physical reasonableness. For complex, multi-step problems, decomposition into manageable subproblems with consistent intermediate results enables successful integration of multiple physics concepts. Mastering these systematic approaches develops critical thinking skills that extend beyond physics to analytical problem solving in all scientific and technical fields."
