  "topic": "1.2 The Scientific Method",
  "expanded_description": "This section details the systematic steps of scientific investigation and experimentation, distinguishing between key scientific concepts like hypothesis, theory, and law. Students will understand how precision differs from accuracy, how scientific knowledge progresses from hypothesis to established theory, and examine landmark physics discoveries that demonstrate the method in action.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The scientific method is a cyclical, self-correcting process that builds reliable knowledge through systematic observation, hypothesis testing, experimentation, and peer validation.",
    "explanation": "Scientific knowledge evolves through a hierarchy of confidence: from initial observations to testable hypotheses, to well-supported theories, and finally to fundamental laws that describe consistent natural patterns."

  "summary": "The scientific method represents a sophisticated hierarchy of knowledge building, from testable hypotheses to comprehensive theories and descriptive laws. Understanding the distinctions between these concepts—particularly that theories don't 'graduate' into laws but serve different explanatory purposes—is crucial for scientific literacy. Measurement quality, encompassing both accuracy (correctness) and precision (consistency), underlies all reliable scientific work. Historical physics breakthroughs demonstrate how systematic application of the scientific method, combined with creative insight, has repeatedly expanded human understanding of the universe, from Newton's celestial mechanics to the recent Higgs boson discovery. This framework continues to drive progress as new questions emerge from each answered inquiry."
