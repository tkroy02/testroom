  "topic": "Unit 1: Scientific Method",
  "expanded_description": "This comprehensive unit introduces Grade 9 students to the systematic approach of scientific inquiry. Students will master the step-by-step process of scientific investigation, from initial observations to evidence-based conclusions. The unit emphasizes developing critical thinking skills, understanding variables and controls, and recognizing the self-correcting nature of scientific knowledge through peer review and repeated experimentation.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Science is an evidence-based, systematic process for investigating and understanding the natural world through observable, measurable, and repeatable methods.",
    "explanation": "The scientific method provides a structured framework that minimizes bias and maximizes reliability. It represents a continuous cycle of inquiry where questions lead to testable hypotheses, which are then evaluated through controlled experimentation, resulting in conclusions that either support or reject the original predictions."

      "introduction": "Scientific inquiry represents a systematic approach to understanding the natural world that distinguishes science from other ways of knowing. It relies on empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and skepticism to build reliable knowledge.",

        "definition": "Scientific Method: A cyclical process involving observation, question formulation, hypothesis development, experimentation, data analysis, and conclusion\nEmpirical Evidence: Data collected through direct observation, measurement, or experimentation that can be verified by others\nHypothesis: A testable, falsifiable proposed explanation based on limited evidence that serves as starting point for further investigation",
        "context": "The scientific method is iterative rather than linear - scientists frequently revisit earlier steps, modify hypotheses based on new evidence, and explore unexpected findings that emerge during investigation."
