Experimental design questions build skills in planning investigations, identifying variables, and ensuring reliable results. Data interpretation questions enhance ability to extract meaning from graphs and experimental data. Integrated application problems challenge students to synthesize multiple concepts in realistic scenarios, developing holistic understanding of scientific inquiry. Together, these question types reinforce learning, identify areas needing further study, and build confidence in applying scientific thinking to diverse contexts, preparing students for advanced scientific study and real-world problem solving."
