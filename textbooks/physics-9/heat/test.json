          "explanation": "Metal is a better thermal conductor than wood. When you touch the metal spoon, heat flows rapidly from your hand into the spoon, making your skin feel cold. With wood, heat transfer is slower, so your skin doesn't cool as quickly. Both spoons are actually at room temperature."

          "process": "Question 5: Using kinetic theory, explain why pressure in a sealed container increases when temperature increases, even though the number of molecules remains constant.",
          "explanation": "According to kinetic theory, temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of molecules ($\\frac{3}{2}k_BT$). When temperature increases, molecules move faster and collide with the walls more frequently and with greater force. Since pressure results from molecular collisions with container walls, both increased collision frequency and greater force per collision cause pressure to increase."

        {
          "process": "Question 6: Why can't a heat engine be 100% efficient? Explain using both the First and Second Laws of Thermodynamics.",
          "explanation": "First Law: Energy would be conserved even with 100% efficiency, so it doesn't forbid it. Second Law: A 100% efficient engine would convert all heat input to work with no heat rejection to a cold reservoir. This violates the Kelvin-Planck statement of the Second Law, which says no process can have the sole result of absorbing heat from a reservoir and converting it entirely to work. Some heat must always be rejected to a cold reservoir, making $\\eta < 100\\%$."
