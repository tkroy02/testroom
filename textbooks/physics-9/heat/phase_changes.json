  "expanded_description": "This section examines phase changes - the transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states. Students will learn about latent heat, the energy required for phase transitions, and how temperature remains constant during these changes despite energy input or removal.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Phase changes occur when substances transition between solid, liquid, and gas states. During these transitions, temperature remains constant while energy is absorbed or released to break or form intermolecular bonds.",
    "explanation": "The energy required for phase changes is called latent heat, which goes into changing the potential energy of molecular arrangements rather than increasing kinetic energy (temperature). This creates temperature plateaus during heating and cooling processes."

  "summary": "Phase changes are transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states that occur at characteristic temperatures and pressures. During these transitions, temperature remains constant while energy is absorbed or released as latent heat: $Q = mL$ where $L_f$ is for fusion (solid-liquid) and $L_v$ for vaporization (liquid-gas). Water requires $334,000\\,J/kg$ to melt and $2,260,000\\,J/kg$ to vaporize. Heating curves show temperature increases in single-phase regions and horizontal plateaus during phase changes. Phase diagrams graphically represent phase stability regions, with key features including the triple point (three phases coexist) and critical point (liquid-gas distinction vanishes). Molecularly, phase changes involve reorganizing molecular arrangements and overcoming intermolecular forces. Phase changes are crucial in refrigeration, weather systems, and thermal energy storage using phase change materials (PCMs). Understanding phase changes explains everyday phenomena from cooking to climate and enables technologies for energy management and temperature control."
