Students will learn to identify each mechanism, apply the appropriate mathematical models, and understand how heat transfer occurs in various physical situations.",

    "principle": "Heat transfer occurs through three distinct mechanisms: conduction (direct molecular contact), convection (fluid motion), and radiation (electromagnetic waves). Each mechanism follows different physical laws and dominates under different conditions.",

Thermal conductivity ($k$) characterizes conduction ability, convection coefficient ($h$) characterizes fluid heat transfer, and emissivity ($\\epsilon$) characterizes radiative properties. Real-world systems typically involve multiple mechanisms operating simultaneously, analyzed using thermal resistance concepts. Practical applications include building insulation (high R-values), electronics cooling (heat sinks), and energy systems (heat exchangers). Understanding these mechanisms enables control of heat flow for energy efficiency, thermal comfort, and technological applications across scales from microelectronics to planetary climate systems."
