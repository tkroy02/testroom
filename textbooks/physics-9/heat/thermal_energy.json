  "summary": "Temperature measures the average kinetic energy of molecular motion and determines the direction of heat flow, while thermal energy represents the total internal energy due to molecular motion and interactions. Temperature is measured using Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin scales, with Kelvin being fundamental in physics as it starts at absolute zero. The Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics establishes thermal equilibrium and enables temperature measurement. At the molecular level, temperature relates to average kinetic energy through $\\overline{KE} = \\frac{3}{2}k_BT$, and molecular speeds follow $v_{rms} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3RT}{M}}$. Heat capacity quantifies how much energy materials require to change temperature, with water having unusually high specific heat. During phase transitions, latent heat is absorbed or released at constant temperature as energy goes into breaking or forming molecular bonds rather than increasing kinetic energy. Understanding these fundamental concepts provides the foundation for thermal physics and heat transfer analysis."
