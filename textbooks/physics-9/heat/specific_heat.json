  "expanded_description": "This section explores heat as energy transfer between systems due to temperature differences, and specific heat as the property that determines how much materials temperature changes when they absorb or release heat. Students will learn to calculate heat transfers and understand why different materials have different thermal responses.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Heat is energy in transit between systems due to temperature differences. Specific heat capacity quantifies how much heat energy a material requires per unit mass to change its temperature by one degree.",
    "explanation": "When two systems at different temperatures interact thermally, heat flows from the hotter to the colder system until thermal equilibrium is reached. The amount of temperature change depends on the material's specific heat capacity and its mass."

  "summary": "Heat is energy transferred between systems due to temperature differences, calculated using $Q = mc\\Delta T$ where $c$ is the specific heat capacity. Different materials have characteristic specific heats: water (4186 J/kg·K) is unusually high, while metals like copper (385 J/kg·K) and lead (128 J/kg·K) are much lower. Calorimetry uses energy conservation (heat lost = heat gained) to measure specific heats or determine final temperatures in thermal interactions. Molar heat capacity expresses heat capacity per mole, revealing that many metals follow the Dulong-Petit law with values around 25 J/mol·K. Microscopically, heat capacity relates to molecular degrees of freedom through the equipartition theorem, with each quadratic degree contributing $\\frac{1}{2}k_BT$ per molecule. Understanding heat and specific heat enables thermal management in engineering, explains climate moderation by oceans, and informs material selection for applications ranging from cooking to energy storage."
