    "principle": "Heat engines operate by taking heat from a high-temperature reservoir, converting some to work, and rejecting waste heat to a low-temperature reservoir. Their efficiency is fundamentally limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics.",
    "explanation": "No heat engine can be 100% efficient because some heat must always be rejected to a cold reservoir. The maximum possible efficiency depends only on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs, not on the engine design."

  "summary": "Heat engines convert thermal energy to mechanical work by operating between hot and cold reservoirs. Their efficiency $\\eta = \\frac{W}{Q_H} = 1 - \\frac{Q_C}{Q_H}$ is fundamentally limited by the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The Carnot engine provides the maximum possible efficiency $\\eta_{Carnot} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$, depending only on reservoir temperatures in Kelvin. Real engines include steam turbines (Rankine cycle, 35-45% efficiency), internal combustion engines (Otto cycle, 25-30%), and gas turbines (Brayton cycle, 35-45%). Efficiency losses occur due to friction, heat transfer across finite temperature differences, and other irreversibilities. Refrigerators and heat pumps operate in reverse, using work to move heat from cold to hot, with performance measured by coefficient of performance ($COP$). Modern systems use combined cycles and cogeneration to achieve efficiencies up to 60% and overall energy utilization up to 90%. Understanding heat engines is crucial for power generation, transportation, and energy policy, as they convert most of the world's primary energy into useful work."
