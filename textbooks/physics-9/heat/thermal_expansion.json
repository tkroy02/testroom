    "explanation": "Thermal expansion occurs in all states of matter but is most pronounced in gases, moderate in liquids, and smallest in solids. The expansion coefficients quantify how much different materials expand per degree temperature change."

  "summary": "Thermal expansion occurs when materials expand upon heating due to increased atomic vibrations in asymmetric potential wells. Linear expansion follows $\\Delta L = \\alpha L_0 \\Delta T$, area expansion $\\Delta A = 2\\alpha A_0 \\Delta T$, and volume expansion $\\Delta V = \\beta V_0 \\Delta T$ with $\\beta = 3\\alpha$ for isotropic solids. Different materials have characteristic expansion coefficients: metals like aluminum ($24\\times 10^{-6}\\,K^{-1}$) expand more than glass ($9\\times 10^{-6}\\,K^{-1}$). Water exhibits anomalous behavior - it expands when freezing and has maximum density at 4°C, which is crucial for aquatic ecosystems. Engineering applications include expansion joints in bridges, bimetallic strips in thermostats, and tolerance design in machinery. When expansion is constrained, significant thermal stress develops according to $\\sigma = E\\alpha\\Delta T$. Understanding thermal expansion is essential for designing structures, manufacturing precision instruments, and predicting material behavior in varying thermal environments."
