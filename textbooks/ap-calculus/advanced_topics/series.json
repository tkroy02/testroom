Students will practice determining convergence/divergence, finding sums of convergent series, and applying series to real-world problems including Taylor series approximations.",

Sequences are ordered lists that may converge to limits, while series are sums of sequence terms that may converge to finite values. Key convergence tests include the nth term test (necessary but not sufficient), geometric series test (|r| < 1), p-series test (p > 1), comparison tests, ratio test, root test, and integral test. Power series represent functions as infinite polynomials with specific radii of convergence, with Taylor series providing optimal polynomial approximations. Applications range from calculating mathematical constants (π, e) to modeling physical phenomena and computational algorithms. Verification through error bounds, partial sum analysis, and comparison with known results ensures accurate conclusions. Mastering sequences and series is essential for advanced calculus, differential equations, and mathematical modeling in science and engineering."
