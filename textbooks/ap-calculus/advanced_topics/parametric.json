  "expanded_description": "This section introduces parametric equations as an alternative way to describe curves by expressing both x and y coordinates as functions of a third variable, called a parameter. Students will learn to graph parametric curves, eliminate parameters to find Cartesian equations, and understand the advantages of parametric representations for describing motion and complex curves.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Parametric equations define curves using a parameter (usually t) that independently determines x and y coordinates: x = f(t), y = g(t). This approach can describe curves that are difficult or impossible to represent as functions y = f(x), and naturally models motion where t represents time.",
    "explanation": "Instead of relating x and y directly, parametric equations use a parameter t to generate points (x,y) on a curve. As t varies over its domain, the point (f(t), g(t)) traces out the curve. This method is particularly useful for describing closed curves, loops, and curves that double back on themselves."

This approach can represent curves that are not functions in the Cartesian sense, naturally model motion where the parameter represents time, and describe complex curves with loops or self-intersections. Key skills include graphing parametric curves by plotting points in parameter order, eliminating the parameter to find Cartesian equations, and calculating derivatives using the chain rule formula dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt). Parametric equations have wide applications in physics (projectile motion, circular motion), engineering (mechanical systems), and computer graphics. Special curves like cycloids, cardioids, and Lissajous figures are most naturally described parametrically. Verification through point testing, derivative consistency checks, and multiple approaches ensures accurate analysis. Mastering parametric equations expands the toolkit for curve description and motion modeling beyond traditional function-based approaches."
