  "expanded_description": "This section introduces vector-valued functions, which assign a vector to each value of a parameter (usually time). Students will learn to perform calculus operations on vector functions, including differentiation and integration, and apply these concepts to analyze motion in space, including velocity, acceleration, and arc length.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A vector-valued function r(t) = ⟨f(t), g(t), h(t)⟩ describes a curve in space by giving the position vector at each parameter value t. Calculus operations are performed component-wise, allowing us to analyze motion, curvature, and other geometric properties of space curves.",
    "explanation": "Vector functions extend single-variable calculus to multidimensional motion. The derivative r'(t) gives the velocity vector (tangent to the curve), and the second derivative r''(t) gives acceleration. Integration of vector functions yields displacement or other vector quantities."

Arc length is computed by integrating the speed (magnitude of velocity) over the parameter interval. Vector calculus provides powerful tools for analyzing motion in space, with applications in physics (projectile motion, orbits), engineering (robot path planning), and computer graphics (curve modeling).
