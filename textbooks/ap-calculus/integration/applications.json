  "expanded_description": "This section explores advanced applications of the substitution method, tackling more complex integrals that require creative u-choices, multiple substitutions, or sophisticated algebraic manipulation. Students will develop deeper pattern recognition skills and learn to handle challenging substitution problems that appear in real-world applications.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Advanced u-substitution problems often require recognizing subtle patterns, using trigonometric identities, applying multiple substitutions, or manipulating the integrand into a suitable form before substitution can be applied effectively.",
    "explanation": "While basic substitution handles clear f(g(x))g'(x) patterns, advanced applications involve integrals where the substitution isn't immediately obvious, requires algebraic creativity, or needs to be applied in sequence. These skills are essential for integrating the complex functions that arise in physics, engineering, and higher mathematics."
