    "principle": "The Change Theorem states that the net change in a quantity over an interval equals the definite integral of its rate of change over that interval. If Q'(t) is the rate of change of quantity Q, then the net change from t=a to t=b is ∫[a,b] Q'(t) dt = Q(b) - Q(a).",

This theorem has widespread applications across physics (position from velocity, work from force), economics (total cost from marginal cost, revenue from sales rate), biology (population change from growth rates), and many other fields. Key distinctions include net change (signed integral) versus total change (integral of absolute value), which correspond to displacement versus distance traveled in motion problems. Successful application requires careful identification of the rate function, proper setup of the definite integral, attention to units, and meaningful interpretation of results. The Change Theorem transforms difficult accumulation problems into manageable integration problems and provides the mathematical foundation for quantitative analysis of change in continuous systems."
