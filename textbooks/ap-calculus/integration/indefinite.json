Basic integration rules include the power rule (∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C for n ≠ -1), constant multiple rule, and sum/difference rule. Algebraic manipulation is often necessary before applying integration rules. Initial value problems use given conditions to determine the specific constant C. Indefinite integrals have important applications in recovering functions from their rates of change in physics, economics, and biology. Verification by differentiation ensures integration accuracy, and mastery of indefinite integrals provides the foundation for definite integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."
