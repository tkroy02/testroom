The three main types are: left Riemann sums (using left endpoints), which tend to underestimate increasing functions and overestimate decreasing functions; right Riemann sums (using right endpoints), with the opposite bias; and midpoint Riemann sums (using midpoints), which typically provide the most accurate approximation due to error cancellation. The approximation improves as the number of subintervals n increases, with the Riemann sum converging to the exact integral as n→∞. Riemann sums are essential for numerical integration of functions without elementary antiderivatives, for working with discrete data, and for understanding the fundamental concept of the definite integral as a limit of sums. Mastering Riemann sums provides both practical computational tools and deep conceptual understanding of integration."
