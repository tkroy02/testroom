Slope fields provide geometric insight into solution behavior, and equilibrium solutions reveal stable and unstable states. Verification by substitution ensures correctness, and interpretation connects mathematical solutions to real-world meaning. Differential equations appear throughout science and engineering, modeling everything from population dynamics and chemical reactions to electrical circuits and mechanical systems.
