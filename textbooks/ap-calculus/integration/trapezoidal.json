  "expanded_description": "This section explores advanced numerical integration methods, particularly the Trapezoidal Rule and Simpson's Rule, which provide more accurate approximations of definite integrals than basic Riemann sums. Students will learn to apply these methods, understand their error characteristics, and choose appropriate approximation techniques for different situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Numerical integration methods approximate definite integrals using geometric shapes that better fit curves than rectangles. The Trapezoidal Rule uses trapezoids, while Simpson's Rule uses parabolic arcs, both providing significantly improved accuracy over basic Riemann sums.",
    "explanation": "These methods work by dividing the area under a curve into segments and approximating each segment with a shape that more closely matches the curve's behavior. The Trapezoidal Rule typically has error proportional to 1/n², while Simpson's Rule has error proportional to 1/n⁴, making them much more efficient than the 1/n error of basic Riemann sums."

Simpson's Rule requires an even number of subintervals and follows the coefficient pattern 1, 4, 2, 4, 2, ..., 4, 1. These methods are essential for integrating non-elementary functions, working with experimental data, and computer implementations. Error analysis through method comparison and convergence testing ensures reliable results. Advanced techniques like adaptive quadrature and Romberg integration provide even greater efficiency and accuracy. Mastering numerical integration enables solving real-world problems across science, engineering, and data analysis where exact solutions are impossible."
