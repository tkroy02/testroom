  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the substitution method (u-substitution), which is the integration counterpart to the chain rule for differentiation. Students will learn to recognize patterns suitable for u-substitution, perform the substitution process correctly, and apply this fundamental technique to evaluate integrals that are composites of functions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The substitution method reverses the chain rule by identifying an inner function u = g(x) whose derivative u' = g'(x) appears in the integrand. This transforms the integral into a simpler form that can be evaluated directly.",
    "explanation": "If ∫f(g(x))g'(x)dx, then let u = g(x), so du = g'(x)dx, and the integral becomes ∫f(u)du. This method works when the integrand contains a function and its derivative (up to a constant multiple)."

  "summary": "The substitution method (u-substitution) is the fundamental technique for integrating composite functions, serving as the inverse operation to the chain rule. The key insight is recognizing when an integrand contains a function and its derivative (or a constant multiple thereof). The process involves: identifying u as the inner function, computing du, substituting to transform the integral into ∫f(u)du, integrating, and then substituting back to the original variable. Successful application requires pattern recognition, algebraic manipulation to create the needed derivative factor when necessary, and careful handling of definite integrals through limit changes. Common applications include exponential composites, trigonometric integrals, and logarithmic forms. Verification by differentiation ensures accuracy, while practice with diverse examples builds the intuition needed to spot substitution opportunities quickly. Mastering u-substitution provides the foundation for more advanced integration techniques and is essential for solving a wide range of integrals encountered in calculus applications."
