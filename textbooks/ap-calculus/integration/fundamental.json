    "principle": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus reveals that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. Part 1 shows how to differentiate an integral, while Part 2 provides a practical method for evaluating definite integrals using antiderivatives.",
    "explanation": "The FTC bridges the two main branches of calculus: differential calculus (studying rates of change) and integral calculus (studying accumulation). It demonstrates that the process of finding areas (integration) is the reverse of finding slopes (differentiation)."

  "summary": "The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus establishes the deep connection between differentiation and integration, showing they are inverse operations. FTC Part 1 states that if F(x) = ∫[a,x] f(t) dt, then F'(x) = f(x), meaning the derivative of an accumulation function equals the original function. FTC Part 2 provides the practical method for evaluating definite integrals: ∫[a,b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a), where F is any antiderivative of f. When integration limits are functions of x, we combine FTC with the chain rule. The FTC has profound applications in physics (connecting velocity to position), economics (relating marginal quantities to totals), and many other fields. Mastering the FTC is essential for understanding the unity of calculus and for practical computation of definite integrals. Verification through Riemann sums, simple test cases, and conceptual analysis ensures deep understanding of this cornerstone theorem of calculus."
