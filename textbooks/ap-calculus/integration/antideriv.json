The general antiderivative of a function f(x) is written as ∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C, where F'(x) = f(x) and C is the constant of integration. Basic rules include the power rule (∫xⁿ dx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C for n ≠ -1), constant multiple rule, and sum rule. Initial value problems use given conditions to determine the specific constant C. Antiderivatives have important applications in recovering position from velocity, cost from marginal cost, and other real-world scenarios where we work backward from rates of change. Mastering antiderivatives provides the essential foundation for the study of integration and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."
