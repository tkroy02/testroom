Students will learn the formal definition of definite integrals as limits of Riemann sums, understand the geometric interpretation of definite integrals as net area, and begin developing the skills needed to evaluate definite integrals.",

    "principle": "The definite integral ∫[a,b] f(x) dx represents the net area between the function f(x) and the x-axis from x = a to x = b. Areas above the x-axis contribute positively, while areas below contribute negatively to this net value.",
    "explanation": "Definite integrals are defined as the limit of Riemann sums: ∫[a,b] f(x) dx = lim[n→∞] Σ[i=1 to n] f(x_i*) Δx, where Δx = (b-a)/n and x_i* is a sample point in the i-th subinterval. This limit gives the exact net area under the curve."

Definite integrals have important properties including additivity over intervals, constant multiples, and sum/difference rules. The geometric interpretation as net area means areas above the x-axis contribute positively while areas below contribute negatively. Applications include calculating distance from velocity, total cost from marginal cost, and average values of functions. Mastery of definite integrals provides the foundation for understanding accumulation and net change in mathematics, physics, economics, and engineering."
