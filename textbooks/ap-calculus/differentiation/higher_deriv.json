  "expanded_description": "This section explores higher-order derivatives - the derivatives of derivatives. Students will learn to compute second and third derivatives, understand their geometric and physical interpretations, and apply them to analyze function behavior including concavity, acceleration, and rate of change of acceleration.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Higher-order derivatives provide deeper insights into function behavior. The second derivative describes curvature and concavity, while the third derivative provides information about how the curvature itself is changing.",
    "explanation": "Just as the first derivative measures instantaneous rate of change, higher derivatives measure rates of change of previous derivatives. This creates a hierarchy of information about function behavior at both local and global scales."

  "summary": "Higher-order derivatives provide increasingly detailed information about function behavior. The first derivative measures slope and instantaneous rate of change. The second derivative describes concavity and acceleration - positive second derivative indicates concave up (minimum), negative indicates concave down (maximum). The third derivative measures jerk (rate of change of acceleration) and helps identify inflection points. In motion analysis, successive derivatives of position give velocity, acceleration, and jerk. The second derivative test is a valuable tool for classifying critical points in optimization problems. Understanding higher-order derivatives enables complete analysis of function behavior and has applications across physics, engineering, economics, and other fields."
