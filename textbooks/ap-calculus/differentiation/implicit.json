  "topic": "2.9 Implicit Differentiation",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces implicit differentiation, a powerful technique for finding derivatives of functions that are not explicitly defined as y=f(x) but are instead defined by relationships between x and y. Students will learn to differentiate both sides of an equation with respect to x, handle the chain rule with y, and solve for the derivative dy/dx.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "When a function is defined implicitly by an equation in x and y, we differentiate both sides with respect to x, treating y as a function of x (y(x)) and applying the chain rule accordingly. The final step is to solve the resulting equation for dy/dx.",
    "explanation": "The key insight is that y is an implicit function of x. Therefore, whenever we differentiate a term containing y, we must apply the chain rule: d/dx[f(y)] = f'(y) · dy/dx. This introduces the derivative dy/dx into the equation, which we then algebraically isolate."

  "summary": "Implicit differentiation is essential for finding derivatives of functions defined implicitly by equations relating x and y. The core idea is to differentiate both sides with respect to x while treating y as a function of x, which introduces dy/dx through the chain rule. The derivative is then obtained by solving the resulting equation for dy/dx. This technique is particularly valuable for equations that are difficult or impossible to solve explicitly for y, for finding higher order derivatives, for locating vertical and horizontal tangents, and for solving related rates problems. Mastery of implicit differentiation expands the range of functions we can differentiate and provides powerful tools for mathematical modeling in geometry, physics, and economics."
