  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the chain rule, one of the most important and frequently used differentiation rules. The chain rule allows us to differentiate composite functions - functions made by combining other functions. Students will learn to identify composite functions, apply the chain rule systematically, and use it to differentiate a wide variety of functions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The chain rule provides a method for differentiating composite functions. If y = f(g(x)), then the derivative is the product of the derivative of the outer function (with the inside function left alone) and the derivative of the inner function.",
    "explanation": "The chain rule can be thought of as: 'derivative of the outside, keeping the inside the same, times derivative of the inside.' This rule is essential for differentiating functions where one function is applied to the result of another function."

  "summary": "The chain rule is used to differentiate composite functions of the form f(g(x)). The rule states that $\\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. In Leibniz notation, if y = f(u) and u = g(x), then $\\frac{dy}{dx} = \\frac{dy}{du} \\cdot \\frac{du}{dx}$. Key steps for application include: (1) identify the inner and outer functions, (2) differentiate the outer function (keeping the inner function unchanged), (3) multiply by the derivative of the inner function, and (4) for multiple compositions, repeat the process working inward. The chain rule frequently combines with other differentiation rules and is essential for differentiating exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, and power functions with non-linear arguments. Mastery of the chain rule is crucial for success in calculus as it appears in nearly all advanced differentiation problems."
