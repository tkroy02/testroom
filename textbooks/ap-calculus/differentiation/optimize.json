The systematic process includes: identifying the quantity to optimize, expressing it as a function of one variable using constraints, finding critical points through differentiation, and testing these points along with domain endpoints. Real-world applications span geometry (maximizing area/volume), business (profit maximization), physics (optimal shapes), and engineering (material minimization). Success requires careful problem analysis, proper domain consideration, and thorough verification of solutions. Mastering optimization provides powerful tools for decision-making across numerous fields where resources are limited and efficiency is valued."
