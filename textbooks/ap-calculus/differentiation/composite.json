Most real-world problems require combining the chain rule with other rules like the product rule and quotient rule. Verification methods such as numerical approximation, multiple solution approaches, and dimensional analysis help ensure accuracy. Mastering these techniques is essential for handling the complex functions that appear in physics, engineering, economics, and other applied fields."
