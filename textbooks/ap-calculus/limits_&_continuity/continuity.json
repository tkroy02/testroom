  "expanded_description": "This section explores the fundamental concept of continuity in calculus, examining what it means for a function to be continuous and the various types of discontinuities that can occur. Students will learn to identify continuous functions, classify discontinuities, and apply the Intermediate Value Theorem.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A function is continuous at a point if it is defined there, has a limit there, and the limit equals the function value. Discontinuities occur when any of these three conditions fails.",
    "explanation": "Continuity ensures that small changes in input produce small changes in output, making functions predictable and well-behaved. Understanding discontinuities helps identify where functions break down and require special treatment."
