  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A limit describes the intended output value ($L$) that a function $f(x)$ approaches as the input ($x$) gets arbitrarily close to a target value ($a$), from both sides, regardless of the function's actual value at $x=a$.",
    "explanation": "Think of a limit as the 'destiny' of the function as it nears a point. We are not concerned with the function's value at the destination itself, but with the consistent, predictable path it takes to get there."

        "definition": "Informally, we say the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $a$ is $L$ if we can make $f(x)$ as close as we desire to $L$ by taking $x$ sufficiently close to $a$, from both the left and the right, without actually letting $x$ equal $a$.",
        "context": "This concept resolves situations where direct substitution fails. For example, when investigating instantaneous velocity, we cannot use the formula 'distance over time' at a single instant, but we can examine what value this ratio approaches as the time interval shrinks to zero."
