  "expanded_description": "This section explores the Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT), a fundamental result in calculus that guarantees continuous functions take on all intermediate values between their endpoints. Students will learn to apply IVT to prove existence of roots, solve equations, and analyze function behavior.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Intermediate Value Theorem states that continuous functions on closed intervals must take every value between their endpoints. This provides a powerful tool for proving existence of solutions.",
    "explanation": "IVT relies on the intuitive idea that continuous functions cannot 'jump' from one value to another without passing through all intermediate values. This theorem is essential for proving existence of roots and solving equations where exact solutions are difficult to find."

The theorem requires continuity on the entire closed interval and that the target value lies strictly between the function values at the endpoints."
