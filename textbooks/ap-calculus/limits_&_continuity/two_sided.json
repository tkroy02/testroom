  "expanded_description": "This section explores the concepts of left-hand and right-hand limits, which describe the behavior of functions as they approach a point from specific directions. Understanding one-sided limits is crucial for analyzing discontinuities, piecewise functions, and endpoints of domains.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A two-sided limit exists only when both one-sided limits exist and are equal. One-sided limits allow us to analyze function behavior at points where the function may behave differently from different directions.",
    "explanation": "Left-hand limits examine approach from smaller values, right-hand limits from larger values. When these match, the overall limit exists; when they differ, we have jump discontinuities or other interesting behavior."
