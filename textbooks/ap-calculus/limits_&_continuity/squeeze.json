  "expanded_description": "This section explores the Squeeze Theorem (also known as the Sandwich Theorem), a powerful technique for evaluating limits of functions that are bounded between two other functions with known limits. Students will learn to apply this theorem to evaluate challenging limits, particularly those involving trigonometric functions and oscillatory behavior.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The Squeeze Theorem allows us to determine the limit of a function by 'squeezing' it between two other functions that have the same limit at a point. If a function is trapped between two functions that converge to the same value, it must also converge to that value.",

This theorem is particularly valuable for evaluating limits of oscillatory functions, proving fundamental trigonometric limits, and dealing with functions that are difficult to analyze directly. The key steps are: (1) find appropriate bounding functions, (2) verify the inequalities hold, (3) compute the limits of the bounding functions, and (4) apply the theorem. Mastering the Squeeze Theorem provides a powerful tool for establishing limits that might otherwise be very challenging to evaluate."
