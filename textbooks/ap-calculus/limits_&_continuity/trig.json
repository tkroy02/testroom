"principle": "Limits of trigonometric functions can be evaluated using direct substitution for continuous functions, but require special techniques and key identities when they result in indeterminate forms like 0/0.",
"explanation": "Trigonometric functions are continuous on their domains, so direct substitution often works. However, special limits and identities are essential tools for resolving indeterminate forms."
