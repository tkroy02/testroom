  "expanded_description": "This section explores the end behavior of functions, describing what happens to the output values (y) as the input values (x) become infinitely large or infinitely small. This behavior is formally described using limits at infinity and is visually represented by horizontal asymptotes.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A limit at infinity describes the value a function approaches as x increases or decreases without bound. A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that the graph of the function approaches as x → ∞ or x → -∞.",
    "explanation": "While regular limits examine behavior near a specific point, limits at infinity describe the long-term trend of a function. A function can cross a horizontal asymptote, but its overall behavior will be to get closer and closer to that line."
