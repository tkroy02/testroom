Successful problem-solving requires a systematic approach: define a coordinate system, identify known variables, select the appropriate equation (often by noting which variable is missing), solve algebraically then numerically, and verify the answer's reasonableness. Free fall motion is a special case where a = -9.8 m/s² (assuming upward is positive), exhibiting symmetric properties. Common errors include sign inconsistencies, unit mismatches, and misapplying the equations to non-constant acceleration scenarios. Mastering these calculations provides the foundation for analyzing a wide range of motion problems in physics."
