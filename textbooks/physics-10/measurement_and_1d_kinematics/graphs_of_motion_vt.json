  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on analyzing velocity-time (v-t) graphs to extract detailed information about an object's motion. Students will learn to interpret values, slopes, and areas to determine acceleration, displacement, and distance, and connect graphical representations to the kinematics of motion.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The slope of a velocity-time graph represents the object's acceleration, and the area under the graph represents its displacement. The area under the speed-time curve (absolute value of velocity) represents distance.",
    "explanation": "Velocity-time graphs provide a direct view of how velocity changes. The slope quantifies the rate of that change (acceleration), while the accumulated area quantifies the result of that motion (change in position). This makes v-t graphs powerful tools for solving motion problems without equations."

The slope of the graph at any point equals the object's instantaneous acceleration. A positive slope means positive acceleration; a negative slope means negative acceleration. The area between the graph and the time axis represents the object's displacement. Area above the axis is positive displacement; area below is negative displacement. The total displacement is the net area. The total distance traveled is the sum of the absolute values of all areas. A key skill is distinguishing between the value of the graph (which gives velocity and direction) and the slope of the graph (which gives acceleration). Confusing v-t graphs with d-t graphs is a common error that must be avoided."
