  "summary": "Scalar quantities have only magnitude (mass, temperature, time), while vector quantities have both magnitude and direction (displacement, velocity, force). Vectors can be represented in magnitude-direction form, component form, or unit vector notation. Vector addition follows the tip-to-tail or parallelogram methods graphically, or component addition mathematically. Vector subtraction involves adding the negative vector. Scalar multiplication changes magnitude but not direction (unless negative). Unit vectors (î, ĵ, k̂) have magnitude 1 and represent pure directions. Vector analysis is essential for solving physics problems involving forces, motion, and equilibrium. Common errors include confusing scalars with vectors, adding magnitudes directly, and misapplying component signs. Proper problem-solving involves choosing a coordinate system, resolving vectors into components, performing operations, and recombining results. Visual methods using scale drawings help develop intuition and verify calculations. Understanding vectors is fundamental for describing physical phenomena where direction matters."
