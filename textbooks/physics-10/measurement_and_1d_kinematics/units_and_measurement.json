  "summary": "The International System of Units (SI) provides a standardized framework for scientific measurements with seven base units: meter (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount), and candela (luminosity). Derived units combine base units to represent physical quantities like force (newton), energy (joule), and power (watt). Dimensional analysis verifies equation validity by checking unit consistency. Unit conversions require accurate application of conversion factors, particularly between metric and imperial systems. Measurement instruments range from simple rulers (±1 mm) to precision tools like vernier calipers (±0.1 mm) and micrometers (±0.01 mm). Understanding precision (reproducibility) versus accuracy (correctness) and properly reporting measurement uncertainty with significant figures are essential skills. Historical systems evolved from body-based units to artifact standards to modern definitions based on fundamental constants. Practical measurement exercises develop skills in instrument use and uncertainty propagation. Specialized units like astronomical units, electronvolts, and atomic mass units serve specific scientific fields while maintaining coherence with the SI system. Mastery of units and measurement provides the foundation for quantitative analysis throughout physics."
