Velocity is a vector quantity representing the rate of displacement (how fast and in what direction), calculated as displacement/time. Average values describe motion over intervals, while instantaneous values describe motion at specific moments. In one-dimensional motion, velocity's sign indicates direction. In two-dimensional motion, velocity has components and requires vector mathematics. Relative velocity describes motion between different reference frames. Speed is always equal to or greater than velocity magnitude, with equality only in straight-line motion without direction changes. Graphical analysis uses slopes of position-time graphs for velocity and absolute values for speed. Common errors include confusing scalars with vectors, misapplying average calculations, and ignoring directional information. Proper problem-solving requires clear distinction between distance and displacement, appropriate unit handling, and understanding of reference frames."
