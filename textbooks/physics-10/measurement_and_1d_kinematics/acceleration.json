  "expanded_description": "This section explores acceleration as the rate of change of velocity. Students will learn to define acceleration, distinguish it from velocity, calculate average and instantaneous acceleration, interpret its sign and direction, and analyze motion using acceleration concepts.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Acceleration is a vector quantity that measures the rate at which an object's velocity changes with time, encompassing changes in speed, direction, or both.",
    "explanation": "Acceleration is often misunderstood as just 'speeding up,' but it describes any change in velocity. This includes increasing speed, decreasing speed (deceleration), and changing direction at constant speed (e.g., circular motion). The direction of the acceleration vector is crucial for understanding the nature of the motion."

  "summary": "Acceleration is the vector quantity representing the rate of change of velocity (a = Δv/Δt). It occurs whenever there is a change in an object's speed, direction of motion, or both. The direction of the acceleration vector is crucial: acceleration in the direction of motion causes speeding up, while acceleration opposite the direction of motion causes slowing down (deceleration). On a velocity-time graph, the slope represents acceleration. When acceleration is constant, kinematic equations provide powerful tools to solve motion problems without calculus. Common pitfalls include confusing acceleration with velocity, misunderstanding the meaning of zero acceleration, and misinterpreting the sign of acceleration in one-dimensional motion."
