  "expanded_description": "This section focuses on analyzing position-time (d-t) graphs to extract detailed information about an object's motion. Students will learn to interpret slopes, curvatures, and intercepts to determine velocity, identify different types of motion (at rest, constant velocity, acceleration), and connect graphical representations to physical reality.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The slope of a position-time graph at any point represents the object's instantaneous velocity, while the graph's shape reveals the nature of the motion.",
    "explanation": "Position-time graphs provide a visual story of motion. A straight line indicates constant velocity, a curved line indicates acceleration, and a horizontal line indicates rest. The steepness of the slope indicates speed, and the sign of the slope indicates direction."

  "summary": "A position-time (d-t) graph plots an object's position on the vertical axis against time on the horizontal axis. The slope of the graph is equal to the object's velocity. A straight line indicates constant velocity, with the steepness representing the speed and the sign (positive/negative) representing the direction. A curved line indicates acceleration; an upward curve (increasing slope) means the object is speeding up in the positive direction or slowing down in the negative direction, while a downward curve (decreasing slope) means the object is slowing down in the positive direction or speeding up in the negative direction. A horizontal line indicates the object is at rest. The key to mastery is avoiding the confusion between the height of the graph (position) and the slope of the graph (velocity)."
