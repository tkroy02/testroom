  "summary": "Distance is a scalar quantity representing total path length traveled, always positive or zero, and path-dependent. Displacement is a vector quantity representing straight-line change in position from start to end, which can be positive, negative, or zero, and depends only on initial and final positions. In one-dimensional motion, distance is the sum of absolute segment lengths, while displacement is the algebraic sum. In two-dimensional motion, displacement becomes a vector calculated using component methods or Pythagorean theorem. Distance always equals or exceeds displacement magnitude. These concepts form the foundation for defining speed (distance/time) and velocity (displacement/time). Real-world applications include navigation, sports analysis, and motion tracking. Common errors involve confusing scalars with vectors, misapplying sign conventions, and misunderstanding the path-independent nature of displacement. Proper problem-solving requires clear coordinate systems, systematic segment analysis, and verification that distance ≥ |displacement|."
