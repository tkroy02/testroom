  "expanded_description": "This section provides a detailed comparison between static and kinetic friction, exploring their distinct behaviors, mathematical relationships, and practical implications. Students will learn to calculate both types of friction, understand when each applies, and analyze transitions between stationary and moving states.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Static friction prevents relative motion between surfaces at rest, while kinetic friction opposes relative motion between surfaces already moving. Static friction can vary up to a maximum value, while kinetic friction is approximately constant for a given normal force.",
    "explanation": "The fundamental distinction lies in whether surfaces are stationary relative to each other (static) or in relative motion (kinetic). This difference has profound implications for how objects start moving and how they behave once in motion."

Kinetic friction ($f_k$) acts between moving surfaces and is constant at $\\mu_k F_N$, opposing actual motion. Typically $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$, meaning more force is required to start motion than to maintain it. This difference arises from microscopic surface interactions and has important practical implications, such as in anti-lock braking systems where maintaining static friction provides better stopping power. Problem-solving requires first determining if motion occurs (compare applied force to $\\mu_s F_N$), then using the appropriate friction equation. Common errors include using the wrong coefficient for the situation, misunderstanding when static friction equals its maximum value, and misidentifying friction direction in propulsion scenarios."
