  "expanded_description": "This section explores the direct proportional relationship between net force and acceleration as expressed in Newton's Second Law. Students will learn to analyze how changes in net force affect acceleration while mass remains constant, and understand the linear relationship through graphical representations and experimental data.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Acceleration is directly proportional to net force when mass is constant. Doubling the net force doubles the acceleration, and halving the net force halves the acceleration.",
    "explanation": "The relationship $a \\propto F_{\\text{net}}$ (for constant $m$) means that acceleration depends linearly on the net force applied. This direct proportionality is fundamental to understanding how forces control motion and is experimentally verifiable through controlled experiments."

  "summary": "Acceleration is directly proportional to net force when mass remains constant, expressed mathematically as $a \\propto F_{\\text{net}}$ or $a = \\frac{F_{\\text{net}}}{m}$. This linear relationship means that doubling the net force doubles the acceleration, and halving the net force halves the acceleration. The relationship is experimentally verifiable through graphs of acceleration versus net force, which yield straight lines through the origin with slopes equal to $\\frac{1}{m}$. Since both force and acceleration are vectors, they always point in the same direction. Common misconceptions include confusing acceleration with velocity, assuming the proportionality holds when mass changes, and misinterpreting force-acceleration graphs. Understanding this direct proportionality is essential for analyzing motion in contexts ranging from vehicle acceleration to rocket launches."
