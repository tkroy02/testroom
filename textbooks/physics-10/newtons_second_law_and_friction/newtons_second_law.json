  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's Second Law of Motion, which quantitatively relates force, mass, and acceleration. Students will learn to apply the fundamental equation $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$ to analyze motion, solve problems involving multiple forces, and understand the vector nature of acceleration.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. The direction of acceleration is the same as the direction of the net force.",
    "explanation": "Newton's Second Law provides the mathematical relationship that connects the concepts of force and motion. While the First Law describes what happens when $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = 0$, the Second Law tells us what happens when $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} \\neq 0$ - the object accelerates in proportion to the net force and in inverse proportion to its mass."

  "summary": "Newton's Second Law, $\\vec{F}_{\\text{net}} = m\\vec{a}$, quantitatively relates force, mass, and acceleration. The net force acting on an object equals its mass times its acceleration, with acceleration always in the direction of the net force. The law applies independently in each coordinate direction: $\\Sigma F_x = ma_x$ and $\\Sigma F_y = ma_y$. Problem-solving requires drawing free-body diagrams, resolving forces into components, and applying the Second Law to each direction. Weight is derived from the Second Law as $W = mg$. For systems of connected objects, the Second Law must be applied to each object separately while maintaining consistency through constraint equations. Common errors include confusing force with velocity, treating forces as scalars rather than vectors, and applying $F = ma$ to individual forces rather than the net force."
