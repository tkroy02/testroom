  "topic": "3.5 Newton's Third Law",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's Third Law of Motion, which describes the fundamental nature of forces as interactions between two objects. Students will learn to identify action-reaction pairs, understand that forces always occur in pairs, and apply this concept to analyze various physical situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "For every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. When object A exerts a force on object B, object B simultaneously exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on object A.",
    "explanation": "Newton's Third Law reveals that forces never occur in isolation - they always exist as pairs between two interacting objects. These action-reaction pairs are always equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and act on different objects."

  "summary": "Newton's Third Law states that for every action force, there is an equal and opposite reaction force. These action-reaction pairs always involve two different objects, have equal magnitude but opposite direction, and occur simultaneously. Key distinctions include: Third Law pairs act on different objects, while balanced forces act on the same object; Third Law pairs don't cancel because they affect different objects; and equal forces can produce different accelerations due to different masses. Common applications include rocket propulsion (pushing exhaust backward to move forward), walking (pushing ground backward to move forward), and gravitational interactions. Frequent errors include confusing Third Law pairs with balanced forces, thinking equal forces prevent motion, and assuming equal forces always produce equal accelerations. Understanding Newton's Third Law is essential for analyzing how objects interact through forces."
