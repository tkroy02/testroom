  "expanded_description": "This section introduces friction as a force that opposes relative motion between surfaces in contact. Students will learn about the nature of friction, its direction, factors affecting its magnitude, and the distinction between static and kinetic friction.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Friction is a contact force that opposes the relative motion or attempted motion between two surfaces in contact. It always acts parallel to the surfaces and opposite to the direction of actual or impending motion.",
    "explanation": "Friction arises from microscopic interactions between surfaces and depends on both the nature of the surfaces and the normal force pressing them together. Unlike many other forces, friction has a maximum possible value and can adjust to match applied forces up to this limit."

  "summary": "Friction is a contact force that opposes relative motion between surfaces. It acts parallel to the surfaces and depends on the normal force and the nature of the materials (coefficient of friction $\\mu$). Static friction ($f_s$) prevents motion from starting and can vary from zero up to a maximum value $\\mu_s F_N$. Kinetic friction ($f_k$) opposes existing motion and is approximately constant at $\\mu_k F_N$. For most material pairs, $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$, making it harder to start motion than to maintain it. Friction does not depend on surface area for most practical situations. Common misconceptions include thinking friction always equals $\\mu F_N$ (it's the maximum for static friction), believing larger area increases friction, and misidentifying friction direction. Understanding friction is essential for analyzing everything from walking and driving to mechanical design and safety systems."
