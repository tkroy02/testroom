  "expanded_description": "This section explores the inverse proportional relationship between mass and acceleration as expressed in Newton's Second Law. Students will learn to analyze how changes in mass affect acceleration while net force remains constant, and understand this inverse relationship through mathematical analysis, graphical representations, and practical examples.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when net force is constant. Doubling the mass halves the acceleration, and halving the mass doubles the acceleration.",
    "explanation": "The relationship $a \\propto \\frac{1}{m}$ (for constant $F_{\\text{net}}$) means that as mass increases, acceleration decreases in a predictable way. This inverse proportionality explains why more massive objects are harder to accelerate and why they resist changes to their motion more strongly."

  "summary": "Acceleration is inversely proportional to mass when net force remains constant, expressed mathematically as $a \\propto \\frac{1}{m}$ or $a = \\frac{F_{\\text{net}}}{m}$. This relationship means that doubling the mass halves the acceleration, and halving the mass doubles the acceleration. Graphically, acceleration versus mass produces a hyperbolic curve, while acceleration versus the reciprocal of mass produces a straight line through the origin with slope equal to the net force. This inverse proportionality quantifies the concept of inertia, explaining why more massive objects are harder to accelerate. Common misconceptions include confusing this relationship with falling object behavior (where gravitational force changes with mass), assuming the inverse proportionality holds when net force isn't constant, and misinterpreting mass-acceleration graphs. Understanding this relationship is crucial for analyzing everything from everyday experiences with moving objects to engineering design in transportation and aerospace."
