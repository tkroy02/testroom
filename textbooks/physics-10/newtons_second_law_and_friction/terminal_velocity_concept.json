  "expanded_description": "This section explores terminal velocity - the constant maximum speed reached by a falling object when air resistance balances the gravitational force. Students will learn to analyze the forces involved, understand the equilibrium condition, and calculate terminal velocity for different objects and conditions.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Terminal velocity occurs when the upward air resistance force equals the downward gravitational force, resulting in zero net force and constant velocity. This represents a state of dynamic equilibrium where acceleration ceases.",
    "explanation": "As a falling object accelerates, air resistance increases with speed until it exactly balances the object's weight. At this point, the net force becomes zero, and according to Newton's First Law, the object continues falling at constant terminal velocity."

For quadratic drag ($F \\propto v^2$), terminal velocity is $v_t = \\sqrt{\\frac{2mg}{C_D \\rho A}}$, showing that heavier objects, smaller cross-sectional areas, and lower drag coefficients result in higher terminal velocities. Objects approach terminal velocity asymptotically, typically reaching 95% of $v_t$ within a few time constants. Biological and engineering applications include animal adaptations for gliding, parachute design, and skydiving. Common misconceptions include confusing the cause-effect relationship between acceleration and terminal velocity, ignoring mass dependence, and applying inappropriate drag models. Understanding terminal velocity requires analyzing the competition between constant gravitational force and velocity-dependent air resistance."
