Problems can involve finding acceleration from known forces or determining unknown forces from measured acceleration. For multi-object systems, apply Newton's Second Law to each object separately while using constraints (like common acceleration) to solve simultaneous equations. Common errors include using individual forces instead of net force in $F = ma$, making sign errors in component analysis, ignoring constraint conditions in connected systems, and obtaining physically impossible results. Mastering these applications provides the foundation for solving a wide range of dynamics problems in physics."
