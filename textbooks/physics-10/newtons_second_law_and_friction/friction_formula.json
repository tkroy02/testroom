Static friction follows $f_s \\leq \\mu_s F_N$, reaching its maximum only when motion is impending, while kinetic friction follows $f_k = \\mu_k F_N$ as a constant value during motion. Typically $\\mu_s > \\mu_k$, explaining why starting motion requires more force than maintaining it. The normal force $F_N$ must be calculated carefully for each situation - it equals weight only on horizontal surfaces and changes on inclines ($F_N = mg\\cos\\theta$) or when additional vertical forces act. Common errors include using weight instead of normal force on inclines, selecting the wrong friction coefficient, assuming static friction always equals its maximum value, and making unit conversion mistakes. Despite some limitations, this model provides accurate predictions for most introductory physics applications."
