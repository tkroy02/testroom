  "topic": "2.2 Net Force",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the concept of net force, which is the vector sum of all forces acting on an object. Students will learn to calculate net force in one and two dimensions, understand its relationship with acceleration, and distinguish between balanced and unbalanced force situations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The net force (or resultant force) is the single vector force that represents the combined effect of all individual forces acting on an object. It determines the object's acceleration.",
    "explanation": "Objects typically experience multiple forces simultaneously. The net force is what ultimately matters for predicting changes in motion. If the net force is zero, the object's velocity remains constant. If the net force is non-zero, the object accelerates in the direction of the net force."

  "summary": "The net force is the vector sum of all individual forces acting on an object, calculated using vector addition. In one dimension, this involves simple addition with attention to signs. In two dimensions, forces must be broken into components before summing. When net force equals zero (balanced forces), the object experiences no acceleration and either remains at rest or continues with constant velocity. When net force is non-zero (unbalanced forces), the object accelerates in the direction of the net force, with a = F_net/m. Common errors include treating forces as scalars, confusing motion with net force, and including forces that don't act on the object in question. Understanding net force is essential for predicting and explaining changes in motion."
