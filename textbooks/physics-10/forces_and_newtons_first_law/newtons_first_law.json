  "topic": "2.3 Newton's First Law",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the Law of Inertia. Students will learn to state the law, understand the concept of inertia, distinguish between balanced and unbalanced forces, and apply these concepts to explain real-world motion phenomena.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced net force.",
    "explanation": "Newton's First Law establishes that force is not needed to maintain motion, but rather to change motion. It introduces the fundamental property of matter called inertia - the natural tendency of objects to resist changes to their state of motion."

  "summary": "Newton's First Law states that objects maintain their state of motion (whether at rest or moving with constant velocity) unless acted upon by an unbalanced net force. This introduces the property of inertia - the tendency of objects to resist changes to their motion, quantified by mass. The law explains why objects at rest remain stationary and why moving objects would continue moving forever in the absence of friction or other unbalanced forces. Common misconceptions include thinking force is needed to maintain motion (it's only needed to change motion) and confusing inertia with a force (it's a property). The First Law serves as the foundation for Newtonian mechanics, defining force and establishing inertial reference frames. It provides the fundamental explanation for everyday phenomena like passengers lurching forward when a vehicle stops suddenly."
