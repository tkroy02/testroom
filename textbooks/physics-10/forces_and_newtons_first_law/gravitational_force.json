Students will learn to calculate gravitational force using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, understand the concept of weight as a specific case of gravity, and analyze how gravity varies with distance and mass.",

    "principle": "Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.",
    "explanation": "Gravity is not just about Earth pulling objects down; it's a universal force that acts between all masses. The familiar force we call 'weight' is simply the gravitational force between an object and the Earth (or whatever planet it's on)."

  "summary": "Gravitational force is the universal attraction between all masses, described by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation: F_g = G(m₁m₂/r²). Weight is the specific gravitational force between an object and a planet, calculated as W = mg, where g = GM_planet/R_planet². Gravity follows an inverse-square law, weakening rapidly with distance. The gravitational field model visualizes mass warping space, with field strength g representing force per unit mass. Key applications include explaining orbits, tides, and planetary formation. Common misconceptions include thinking there's no gravity in space (actually microgravity due to free fall), confusing g and G, and believing heavier objects fall faster (they don't in vacuum). Understanding universal gravitation connects everyday weight to cosmic-scale phenomena."
