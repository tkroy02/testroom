  "topic": "2.1 What is a Force",
  "expanded_description": "This section introduces the fundamental concept of a force as an interaction between objects. Students will learn to define a force, identify different types of forces, describe forces as vectors, and understand the effects forces have on objects, including changes in motion and deformations.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "A force is a push or a pull upon an object resulting from its interaction with another object. It is a vector quantity, possessing both magnitude and direction.",
    "explanation": "Forces are the central cause of all changes in motion. They don't just make things move; they can also start, stop, or change the direction of moving objects, or change an object's shape. Because forces are vectors, the direction in which they act is just as important as their strength."

  "summary": "A force is a vector quantity representing a push or a pull on an object due to its interaction with another object. It is measured in Newtons (N), where 1 N accelerates a 1 kg mass at 1 m/s². Forces are categorized as contact forces (require touch, like friction and tension) or field forces (act at a distance, like gravity and magnetism). As vectors, forces have both magnitude (size) and direction, which are both crucial for determining their combined effect. Common misconceptions include the idea that a force is needed to maintain constant motion (it's not) and the confusion between mass (kg, amount of matter) and weight (N, gravitational force). Understanding the true nature of forces is the essential first step toward analyzing motion and equilibrium."
