  "topic": "2.8 Normal Force",
  "expanded_description": "This section explores the normal force - the support force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the contact point. Students will learn to identify normal forces in various situations, calculate their magnitudes, understand how they differ from weight, and analyze normal forces on inclined planes and in accelerating systems.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "The normal force is a contact force exerted by a surface that supports an object, always acting perpendicular (normal) to the surface. It prevents objects from passing through surfaces and adjusts its magnitude to whatever value is needed to provide support.",
    "explanation": "The normal force is often misunderstood as simply being equal to weight. In reality, it's a responsive force that changes based on the situation - it can be equal to, greater than, or less than weight depending on other forces and accelerations present."

  "summary": "The normal force is a contact force exerted perpendicular to a surface that supports an object. It prevents objects from passing through surfaces and adjusts its magnitude to provide whatever support is needed. Key characteristics include: always perpendicular to the surface, can push but not pull, magnitude determined by ΣF_perpendicular = ma_perpendicular, and disappears when contact is lost. On horizontal surfaces at rest with no other vertical forces, F_N = mg, but this is just one special case. On inclined planes, F_N = mg cosθ. In accelerating systems like elevators, F_N changes to provide the net force needed for acceleration, creating sensations of increased or decreased apparent weight. Common errors include assuming F_N always equals weight, drawing F_N in the wrong direction, including F_N without physical contact, and confusing action-reaction pairs. Proper analysis requires applying Newton's Second Law perpendicular to the surface of contact."
