  "expanded_description": "This section explores the conditions for equilibrium, where objects experience no acceleration due to balanced forces. Students will learn to identify equilibrium situations, apply the net force condition, solve for unknown forces, and distinguish between static and dynamic equilibrium.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "An object is in equilibrium when the net force acting on it is zero (ΣF = 0), resulting in no acceleration. In static equilibrium, the object is at rest; in dynamic equilibrium, it moves with constant velocity.",
    "explanation": "Equilibrium occurs when all forces acting on an object are perfectly balanced. This doesn't necessarily mean no forces act on the object - rather, the vector sum of all forces cancels out. The object's motion remains unchanged: either stationary or moving at constant speed in a straight line."

  "summary": "Equilibrium occurs when the net force on an object is zero (ΣF = 0), resulting in no acceleration. In static equilibrium, the object is at rest; in dynamic equilibrium, it moves with constant velocity. Solving equilibrium problems involves identifying all forces, resolving them into components, and applying ΣF_x = 0 and ΣF_y = 0 to solve for unknowns. Common configurations include objects on surfaces, hanging objects, and objects on inclined planes. Key misconceptions include thinking moving objects cannot have balanced forces, forgetting to resolve force components properly, and including forces that act on other objects. Understanding equilibrium is fundamental to analyzing structures, mechanical systems, and everyday situations where objects maintain steady states of motion or rest."
