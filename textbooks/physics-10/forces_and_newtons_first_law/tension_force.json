  "expanded_description": "This section explores tension forces - the pulling forces transmitted through strings, ropes, cables, and chains. Students will learn to analyze tension in various configurations, understand the properties of ideal strings, solve pulley problems, and calculate tension in systems with multiple objects.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Tension is a pulling force transmitted through a flexible connector like a rope or string. It always acts away from objects along the line of the connector and is the same throughout a massless, inextensible string.",
    "explanation": "Tension is fundamentally different from compression forces. While normal forces push objects apart, tension forces pull objects together through flexible connections. The properties of ideal strings simplify many physics problems by ensuring tension is uniform throughout the string."

  "summary": "Tension is a pulling force transmitted through flexible connectors like ropes, strings, and cables. It always acts away from objects along the line of the connector. For ideal massless, inextensible strings, tension is constant throughout the string. Pulleys change the direction of tension but not its magnitude (for ideal pulleys). When ropes are at angles, tension must be resolved into components using trigonometry. Common configurations include single hanging masses, pulled objects, Atwood machines (pulleys with different masses), and objects suspended by multiple ropes. Real-world considerations include massive ropes (where tension varies along the length), elastic strings (following Hooke's Law), and pulley friction. Frequent errors include drawing tension toward objects, assuming tension equals applied force, misunderstanding pulley effects, and incorrectly adding tension magnitudes. Proper tension analysis requires careful free-body diagrams and application of Newton's laws to each object in the system."
