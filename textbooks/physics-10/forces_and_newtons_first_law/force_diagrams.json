  "summary": "Free-body diagrams are essential tools for analyzing forces on objects. They show all external forces acting on a single object as vectors originating from the object's center. Key steps include: isolating the object, identifying all forces (weight, normal, tension, friction, applied), drawing proportional arrows with proper directions, labeling clearly, and establishing a coordinate system. Common forces to identify include weight (always down), normal force (perpendicular to surfaces), tension (along ropes away from object), and friction (opposing motion). Strategic coordinate system selection, such as tilting axes for inclined planes, simplifies calculations. Frequent errors include adding forces that act on other objects, misrepresenting normal force, confusing forces with velocity, and using inconsistent vector scales. Mastering FBDs provides the foundation for successfully applying Newton's laws and solving force-related physics problems."
