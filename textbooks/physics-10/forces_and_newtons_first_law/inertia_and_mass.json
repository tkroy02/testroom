  "expanded_description": "This section delves deeper into the relationship between mass and inertia, exploring how mass quantifies an object's resistance to changes in motion. Students will learn to distinguish between mass and weight, understand inertial mass conceptually, and apply these concepts to analyze different motion scenarios.",
  "core_concept": {
    "principle": "Mass is the quantitative measure of an object's inertia - its resistance to changes in motion. The greater the mass, the greater the force required to produce a given acceleration.",
    "explanation": "Inertia is not just a qualitative concept; it has a precise quantitative measure called mass. This relationship is fundamental to Newton's Second Law (F=ma) and explains why different objects respond differently to the same forces."

  "summary": "Mass is the quantitative measure of an object's inertia - its resistance to changes in motion. Objects with greater mass require greater forces to achieve the same acceleration. Mass is measured in kilograms and remains constant regardless of location, while weight is the gravitational force on an object measured in Newtons and varies with location. There are two equivalent ways to define mass: inertial mass (resistance to acceleration, m = F/a) and gravitational mass (strength of gravitational attraction, m = W/g). The experimental equality of these two masses is fundamental to physics. Understanding mass and inertia explains everyday phenomena from transportation safety to sports performance, and clarifies why different objects respond differently to the same forces. Common errors include confusing mass with weight, associating inertia with size rather than mass, and misunderstanding inertia in weightless environments."
