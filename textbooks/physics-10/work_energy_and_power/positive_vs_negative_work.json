  "summary": "Positive work ($W > 0$) occurs when the force component and displacement are in the same direction ($0^\\circ \\leq \\theta < 90^\\circ$), transferring energy into a system and increasing its mechanical energy. Negative work ($W < 0$) occurs when the force component and displacement are in opposite directions ($90^\\circ < \\theta \\leq 180^\\circ$), removing energy from a system and decreasing its mechanical energy. The work sign indicates the direction of energy flow: positive work adds energy (making objects speed up, gain height, or store energy), while negative work removes energy (slowing objects, lowering them, or dissipating energy as heat). Conservative forces like gravity and springs can do both positive and negative work reversibly, while non-conservative forces like friction typically only do negative work, permanently removing mechanical energy. Common errors include confusing negative work with zero work, misidentifying which force does the work, and incorrectly determining the angle between force and displacement vectors."
