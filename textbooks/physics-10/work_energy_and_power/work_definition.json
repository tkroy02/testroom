Work measures energy transfer and is measured in Joules (1 J = 1 N·m). For work to occur, there must be both a force and a displacement in the direction of the force component. Key points include: work is a scalar quantity despite involving vectors; only the force component parallel to displacement does work; situations with no displacement or perpendicular force and displacement result in zero work; and the physics definition of work differs significantly from everyday notions of effort. Common errors include confusing effort with work, using incorrect displacement measurements, misapplying the angle in the cosine term, and making unit conversion mistakes."
