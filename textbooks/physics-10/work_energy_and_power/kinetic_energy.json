It is a scalar quantity measured in Joules that depends quadratically on velocity - doubling speed quadruples kinetic energy, making velocity the dominant factor. Key characteristics include: always positive or zero; frame-dependent (different values in different reference frames); related to stopping distance through the work-energy theorem; and crucial for understanding collision severity and safety design. Rotational kinetic energy $KE_{\\text{rot}} = \\frac{1}{2}I\\omega^2$ extends the concept to rotating systems. Common errors include confusing velocity with speed, forgetting the $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor, misunderstanding frame dependence, and underestimating the importance of the velocity squared relationship."
