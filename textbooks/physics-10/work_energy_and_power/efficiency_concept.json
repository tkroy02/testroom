It is always less than 100% due to fundamental thermodynamic limits expressed by the Second Law and Carnot efficiency ($\\eta_{\\text{max}} = 1 - \\frac{T_C}{T_H}$). Efficiency can be classified by application (thermal, luminous, mechanical) and is affected by factors like temperature differences, friction, electrical resistance, and design optimization. Improved efficiency has significant economic benefits (reduced energy costs) and environmental benefits (lower emissions). Biological systems typically have lower efficiencies than engineered systems due to biochemical and temperature constraints. Common misconceptions include thinking 100% efficiency is possible, confusing efficiency with energy conservation, equating efficiency with overall effectiveness, and making calculation errors by inverting the efficiency ratio."
