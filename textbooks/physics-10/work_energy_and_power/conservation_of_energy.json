  "summary": "The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed between different forms or transferred between systems. In isolated systems, total energy remains constant regardless of internal processes. Mechanical energy (KE + PE) is conserved only when no non-conservative forces act. Proper system definition is crucial - the same physical situation can show energy conservation or apparent violation depending on what's included in the system. Energy conservation provides powerful problem-solving tools, especially for complex motions where forces are unknown or paths are complicated. Common misconceptions include thinking energy is 'used up,' confusing energy with power, applying conservation to improperly defined systems, and misunderstanding why perpetual motion is impossible. This fundamental principle unifies all branches of physics and has profound implications for science, engineering, and environmental management."
