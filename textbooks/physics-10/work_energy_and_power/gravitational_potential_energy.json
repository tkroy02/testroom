  "summary": "Gravitational potential energy is the energy stored due to an object's height in a gravitational field, given by $PE_g = mgh$ where $m$ is mass, $g$ is gravitational acceleration, and $h$ is height above a reference level. Key principles include: the reference level is arbitrary but must be used consistently; only changes in potential energy ($\\Delta PE_g$) have physical significance; gravitational potential energy converts to kinetic energy during falling and vice versa during rising; work done against gravity equals the increase in potential energy and is path-independent. The $mgh$ formula is an approximation valid near Earth's surface; for large heights or precise calculations, the general formula $PE_g = -GMm/r$ must be used. Applications include hydroelectric power, pumped storage systems, and analyzing motion in gravitational fields. Common errors include treating potential energy as absolute rather than relative, using inconsistent reference levels, and misapplying the $mgh$ approximation beyond its valid range."
