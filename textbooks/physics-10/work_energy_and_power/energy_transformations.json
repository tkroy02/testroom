  "summary": "Energy transformations involve the conversion of energy from one form to another while total energy remains conserved. Common transformations include mechanical (kinetic ↔ potential), mechanical → thermal (through friction), chemical → thermal + mechanical (combustion), and electrical → various forms. No transformation is 100% efficient - some energy always converts to less useful forms, primarily thermal energy. Many transformations are irreversible, proceeding spontaneously in one direction due to entropy increases. Real-world energy systems often involve transformation chains where efficiencies multiply. Key misconceptions include thinking energy is 'used up' rather than transformed, assuming perfect efficiency is possible, ignoring energy quality differences, and failing to account for all transformation steps in complex systems. Understanding energy transformations is essential for analyzing technological systems, environmental impacts, and energy resource management."
