The SI unit is the watt (1 W = 1 J/s), with horsepower (1 hp = 746 W) still commonly used. Instantaneous power can be calculated as $P = F \\cdot v$ when force and velocity are known. Electrical power follows $P = VI$ for DC systems. Key distinctions include: power is a rate (energy per time), while energy is a quantity; high power means rapid energy transfer; and constant power requires force to decrease as velocity increases. Common errors include confusing power with energy, using the wrong force in power calculations, misunderstanding the power-force-velocity relationship, and making unit conversion mistakes. Understanding power is essential for analyzing system performance, energy efficiency, and equipment requirements across mechanical, electrical, and biological systems."
